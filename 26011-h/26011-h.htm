<h2><i>Sunday the Fifteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I opened my eyes and saw a pea-green world all
around me. Then I heard the doctor say: &#8220;Give &#8217;er
another whiff or two.&#8221; His voice sounded far-away,
as though he were speaking through the Simplon
Tunnel, and not merely through his teeth, within
twelve inches of my nose.
</p>
<p>I took my whiff or two. I gulped at that chloroform
like a thirsty Bedouin at a wadi-spring. I went down
into the pea-green emptiness again, and forgot about
the Kelly pad and the recurring waves of pain that
came bigger and bigger and tried to sweep through
my racked old body like breakers through the ribs of
a stranded schooner. I forgot about the hateful metallic
clink of steel things against an instrument-tray,
and about the loganberry pimple on the nose of the
red-headed surgical nurse who&#8217;d been sent into the
labor room to help.
</p>
<p>I went wafting off into a feather-pillowy pit of infinitude.
I even forgot to preach to myself, as I&#8217;d
been doing for the last month or two. I knew that my
time was upon me, as the Good Book says. There are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
a lot of things in this life, I remembered, which woman
is able to squirm out of. But here, Mistress Tabbie,
was one you couldn&#8217;t escape. Here was a situation
that <i>had</i> to be faced. Here was a time I had to knuckle
down, had to grin and bear it, had to go through with
it to the bitter end. For other folks, whatever they
may be able to do for you, aren&#8217;t able to have your
babies for you.
</p>
<p>Then I ebbed up out of the pea-green depths again,
and was troubled by the sound of voices, so thin and
far-away I couldn&#8217;t make out what they were saying.
Then came the beating of a tom-tom, so loud that it
hurt. When that died away for a minute or two I
caught the sound of the sharp and quavery squall of
something, of something which had never squalled before,
a squall of protest and injured pride, of maltreated
youth resenting the ignominious way it must
enter the world. Then the tom-tom beating started up
again, and I opened my eyes to make sure it wasn&#8217;t
the Grenadiers&#8217; Band going by.
</p>
<p>I saw a face bending over mine, seeming to float in
space. It was the color of a half-grown cucumber, and
it made me think of a tropical fish in an aquarium
when the water needed changing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming out, Doctor,&#8221; I heard a woman&#8217;s
voice say. It was a voice as calm as God&#8217;s and slightly
nasal. For a moment I thought I&#8217;d died and gone to
Heaven. But I finally observed and identified the loganberry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
pimple, and realized that the tom-tom beating
was merely the pounding of the steam-pipes in that
jerry-built western hospital, and remembered that I
was still in the land of the living and that the red-headed
surgical nurse was holding my wrist. I felt infinitely
hurt and abused, and wondered why my husband
wasn&#8217;t there to help me with that comforting
brown gaze of his. And I wanted to cry, but didn&#8217;t
seem to have the strength, and then I wanted to say
something, but found myself too weak.
</p>
<p>It was the doctor&#8217;s voice that roused me again. He
was standing beside my narrow iron bed with his
sleeves still rolled up, wiping his arms with a big white
towel. He was smiling as he scrubbed at the corners
of his nails, as though to make sure they were clean.
The nurse on the other side of the bed was also smiling.
So was the carrot-top with the loganberry
beauty-spot. All I could see, in fact, was smiling
faces.
</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t seem a laughing matter to me. I
wanted to rest, to sleep, to get another gulp or two of
that God-given smelly stuff out of the little round tin
can.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you feeling?&#8221; asked the doctor indifferently.
He nodded down at me as he proceeded to manicure
those precious nails of his. They were laughing,
the whole four of them. I began to suspect that I
wasn&#8217;t going to die, after all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s fine and dandy,&#8221; announced the
barearmed farrier as he snapped his little pen-knife
shut. But that triumphant grin of his only made me
more tired than ever, and I turned away to the tall
young nurse on the other side of my bed.
</p>
<p>There was perspiration on her forehead, under the
eaves of the pale hair crowned with its pointed little
cap. She was still smiling, but she looked human and
tired and a little fussed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a girl?&#8221; I asked her. I had intended to make
that query a crushingly imperious one. I wanted it to
stand as a reproof to them, as a mark of disapproval
for all such untimely merriment. But my voice, I
found, was amazingly weak and thin. And I wanted to
know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>It&#8217;s both</i>,&#8221; said the tired-eyed girl in the blue and
white uniform. And she, too, nodded her head in a triumphant
sort of way, as though the credit for some
vast and recent victory lay entirely in her own narrow
lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s both?&#8221; I repeated, wondering why she too
should fail to give a simple answer to a simple question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s twins!&#8221; she said, with a little chirrup of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twins?&#8221; I gasped, in a sort of bleat that drove the
last of the pea-green mist out of that room with the
dead white walls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Twins,&#8221; proclaimed the doctor, &#8220;<i>twins</i>!&#8221; He repeated
the monosyllable, converting it into a clarion-call
that made me think of a rooster crowing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A lovely boy and girl,&#8221; cooed the third nurse with
a bottle of olive-oil in her hand. And by twisting my
head a little I was able to see the two wire bassinets,
side by side, each holding a little mound of something
wrapped in a flannelette blanket.
</p>
<p>I shut my eyes, for I seemed to have a great deal
to think over. Twins! A boy and girl! Two little
new lives in the world! Two warm and cuddling little
bairns to nest close against my mother-breast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see <i>your</i> troubles cut out for you,&#8221; said the doctor
as he rolled down his shirt-sleeves.
</p>
<p>They were all laughing again. But to me it didn&#8217;t
seem quite such a laughing matter. I was thinking
of my layette, and trying to count over my supply of
binders and slips and shirts and nighties and wondering
how I could out-Solomon Solomon and divide
the little dotted Swiss dress edged with the French
Val lace of which I&#8217;d been so proud. Then I fell to
pondering over other problems, equally prodigious, so
that it was quite a long time before my mind had a
chance to meander on to Dinky-Dunk himself.
</p>
<p>And when I did think of Dinky-Dunk I had to
laugh. It seemed a joke on him, in some way. He was
the father of twins. Instead of one little snoozer to
carry on his name and perpetuate his race in the land,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
he now had <i>two</i>. Fate, without consulting him, had
flung him double measure. No wonder, for the moment,
those midnight toilers in that white-walled house
of pain were wearing the smile that refused to come
off! That&#8217;s the way, I suppose, that all life ought to
be welcomed into this old world of ours. And now, I
suddenly remembered, I could speak of <i>my children</i>&mdash;and
that means so much more than talking about one&#8217;s
child. Now I was indeed a mother, a prairie mother
with three young chicks of her own to scratch for.
</p>
<p>I forgot my anxieties and my months of waiting.
I forgot those weeks of long mute protest, of revolt
against wily old Nature, who so cleverly tricks us
into the ways she has chosen. A glow of glory went
through my tired body&mdash;it was hysteria, I suppose,
in the basic meaning of the word&mdash;and I had to shut
my eyes tight to keep the tears from showing.
</p>
<p>But that great wave of happiness which had washed
up the shore of my soul receded as it came. By the
time I was transferred to the rubber-wheeled stretcher
they called &#8220;the Wagon&#8221; and trundled off to a bed and
room of my own, the reaction set in. I could think
more clearly. My Dinky-Dunk didn&#8217;t love me, or he&#8217;d
never have left me at such a time, no matter what his
business calls may have been. The Twins weren&#8217;t quite
so humorous as they seemed. There was even something
disturbingly animal-like in the birth of more
offspring than one at a time, something almost revolting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
in this approach to the littering of one&#8217;s
young. They all tried to unedge that animality by
treating it as a joke, by confronting it with their conspiracies
of jocularity. But it would be no joke to a
nursing mother in the middle of a winter prairie with
the nearest doctor twenty long miles away.
</p>
<p>I countermanded my telegram to Dinky-Dunk at
Vancouver, and cried myself to sleep in a nice relaxing
tempest of self-pity which my &#8220;special&#8221; accepted
as calmly as a tulip-bed accepts a shower. But lawdy,
lawdy, how I slept! And when I woke up and sniffed
warm air and that painty smell peculiar to new buildings,
and heard the radiators sing with steam and the
windows rattle in the northeast blizzard that was blowing,
I slipped into a truer realization of the intricate
machinery of protection all about me, and thanked my
lucky stars that I wasn&#8217;t in a lonely prairie shack, as
I&#8217;d been when my almost three-year-old Dinkie was
born. I remembered, with little tidal waves of contentment,
that my ordeal was a thing of the past, and
that I was a mother twice over, and rather hungry,
and rather impatient to get a peek at my God-given
little babes.
</p>
<p>Then I fell to thinking rather pityingly of my
forsaken little Dinkie and wondering if Mrs. Teetzel
would keep his feet dry and cook his cream-of-wheat
properly, and if Iroquois Annie would have brains
enough not to overheat the furnace and burn Casa
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Grande down to the ground. Then I decided to send
the wire to Dinky-Dunk, after all, for it isn&#8217;t every
day in the year a man can be told he&#8217;s the father of
twins....
</p>
<p>I sent the wire, in the secret hope that it would
bring my lord and master on the run. But it was eight
days later, when I was up on a back-rest and having
my hair braided, that Dinky-Dunk put in an appearance.
And when he did come he chilled me. I can&#8217;t
just say why. He seemed tired and preoccupied and
unnecessarily self-conscious before the nurses when I
made him hold Pee-Wee on one arm and Poppsy on the
other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now kiss &#8217;em, Daddy,&#8221; I commanded. And he had
to kiss them both on their red and puckered little
faces. Then he handed them over with all too apparent
relief, and fell into a brown study.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you worrying over?&#8221; I asked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering how in the world you&#8217;ll ever manage,&#8221;
he solemnly acknowledged. I was able to laugh,
though it took an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For every little foot God sends a little shoe,&#8221; I told
him, remembering the aphorism of my old Irish nurse.
&#8220;And the sooner you get me home, Dinky-Dunk, the
happier I&#8217;ll be. For I&#8217;m tired of this place and the
smell of the formalin and ether and I&#8217;m nearly worried
to death about Dinkie. And in all the wide world,
O Kaikobad, there&#8217;s no place like one&#8217;s own home!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk didn&#8217;t answer me, but I thought he
looked a little wan and limp as he sat down in one of
the stiff-backed chairs. I inspected him with a calmer
and clearer eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that sleeper too hot last night?&#8221; I asked, remembering
what a bad night could do to a big man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to sleep on a train the way I used to,&#8221;
he said, but his eye evaded mine. And I suspected
something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I demanded, &#8220;did you have a berth
last night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flushed up rather guiltily. He even seemed to
resent my questioning him. But I insisted on an answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I sat up,&#8221; he finally confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>And still again his eye tried to evade mine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a bit short of ready cash.&#8221; He tried to say
it indifferently, but the effort was a failure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you tell me that before?&#8221; I asked,
sitting up and spurning the back-rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had worries enough of your own,&#8221; proclaimed
my weary-eyed lord and master. It gave me a squeezy
feeling about the heart to see him looking so much like
an unkempt and overworked and altogether neglected
husband. And there I&#8217;d been lying in the lap of luxury,
with quick-footed ladies in uniform to answer my
bell and fly at my bidding.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve a right, Dunkie, to know your worries,
and stand my share of &#8217;em,&#8221; I promptly told him.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s why I want to get out of this smelly old
hole and back to my home again. I may be the mother
of twins, and only too often reminded that I&#8217;m one of
the Mammalia, but I&#8217;m still your cave-mate and life-partner,
and I don&#8217;t think children ought to come between
a man and wife. I don&#8217;t intend to allow <i>my</i>
children to do anything like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I said it quite bravely, but there was a little cloud
of doubt drifting across the sky of my heart. Marriage
is so different from what the romance-fiddlers
try to make it. Even Dinky-Dunk doesn&#8217;t approve of
my mammalogical allusions. Yet milk, I find, is one
of the most important issues of motherhood&mdash;only it&#8217;s
impolite to mention the fact. What makes me so impatient
of life as I see it reflected in fiction is its trick
of overlooking the important things and over-accentuating
the trifles. It primps and tries to be genteel&mdash;for
Biology doth make cowards of us all.
</p>
<p>I was going to say, very sagely, that life isn&#8217;t so
mysterious after you&#8217;ve been the mother of three children.
But that wouldn&#8217;t be quite right. It&#8217;s mysterious
in an entirely different way. Even love itself is
different, I concluded, after lying there in bed day
after day and thinking the thing over. For there are
so many different ways, I find, of loving a man. You
are fond of him, at first, for what you consider his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
perfections, the same as you are fond of a brand-new
traveling bag. There isn&#8217;t a scratch on his polish or
a flaw in his make-up. Then you live with him for a
few years. You live with him and find that life is making
a few dents in his loveliness of character, that the
edges are worn away, that there&#8217;s a weakness or two
where you imagined only strength to be, and that instead
of standing a saint and hero all in one, he&#8217;s
merely an unruly and unreliable human being with his
ups and downs of patience and temper and passion.
But, bless his battered old soul, you love him none the
less for all that. You no longer fret about him being
unco guid, and you comfortably give up trying to
match his imaginary virtues with your own. You still
love him, but you love him differently. There&#8217;s a touch
of pity in your respect for him, a mellowing compassion,
a little of the eternal mother mixed up with the
eternal sweetheart. And if you are wise you will no
longer demand the impossible of him. Being a woman,
you will still want to be loved. But being a woman of
discernment, you will remember that in some way and
by some means, if you want to be loved, you must remain
lovable.

<h2><i>Thursday the Nineteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I had to stay in that smelly old hole of a hospital
and in that bald little prairie city fully a week longer
than I wanted to. I tried to rebel against being bullied,
even though the hand of iron was padded with
velvet. But the powers that be were too used to handling
perverse and fretful women. They thwarted my
purpose and broke my will and kept me in bed until
I began to think I&#8217;d take root there.
</p>
<p>But once I and my bairns were back here at Casa
Grande I could see that they were right. In the first
place the trip was tiring, too tiring to rehearse in detail.
Then a vague feeling of neglect and desolation
took possession of me, for I missed the cool-handed
efficiency of that ever-dependable &#8220;special.&#8221; I almost
surrendered to funk, in fact, when both Poppsy and
Pee-Wee started up a steady duet of crying. I sat
down and began to sniffle myself, but my sense of
humor, thank the Lord, came back and saved the day.
There was something so utterly ridiculous in that
briny circle, soon augmented and completed by the addition
of Dinkie, who apparently felt as lonely and
overlooked as did his spineless and sniffling mother.
</p>
<p>So I had to tighten the girths of my soul. I took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
a fresh grip on myself and said: &#8220;Look here, Tabbie,
this is never going to do. This is not the way Horatius
held the bridge. This is not the spirit that built
Rome. So, up, Guards, and at &#8217;em! Excelsior!
<i>Audaces fortuna juvat!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>So I mopped my eyes, and readjusted the Twins,
and did what I could to placate Dinkie, who continues
to regard his little brother and sister with a somewhat
hostile eye. One of my most depressing discoveries
on getting back home, in fact, was to find that Dinkie
has grown away from me in my absence. At first he
even resented my approaches, and he still stares at me,
now and then, across a gulf of perplexity. But the
ice is melting. He&#8217;s beginning to understand, after
all, that I&#8217;m his really truly mother and that he can
come to me with his troubles. He&#8217;s lost a good deal
of his color, and I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that his
food hasn&#8217;t been properly looked after during the
last few weeks. It&#8217;s a patent fact, at any rate, that
my house hasn&#8217;t been properly looked after. Iroquois
Annie, that sullen-eyed breed servant of ours, will
never have any medals pinned on her pinny for neatness.
I&#8217;d love to ship her, but heaven only knows
where we&#8217;d find any one to take her place. And I
simply <i>must</i> have help, during the next few months.
</p>
<p>Casa Grande, by the way, looked such a little dot
on the wilderness, as we drove back to it, that a spear
of terror pushed its way through my breast as I realized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
that I had my babies to bring up away out here
on the edge of this half-settled no-man&#8217;s land. If
only our dreams had come true! If only the plans of
mice and men didn&#8217;t go so aft agley! If only the railway
had come through to link us up with civilization,
and the once promised town had sprung up like a
mushroom-bed about our still sad and solitary Casa
Grande! But what&#8217;s the use of repining, Tabbie McKail?
You&#8217;ve the second-best house within thirty miles
of Buckhorn, with glass door-knobs and a laundry-chute,
and a brood to rear, and a hard-working husband
to cook for. And as the kiddies get older, I imagine,
I&#8217;ll not be troubled by this terrible feeling of
loneliness which has been weighing like a plumb-bob
on my heart for the last few days. I wish Dinky-Dunk
didn&#8217;t have to be so much away from home....
</p>
<p>Old Whinstane Sandy, our hired man, has presented
me with a hand-made swing-box for Poppsy and Pee-Wee,
a sort of suspended basket-bed that can be hung
up in the porch as soon as my two little snoozers are
able to sleep outdoors. Old Whinnie, by the way, was
very funny when I showed him the Twins. He solemnly
acknowledged that they were nae sae bad, conseederin&#8217;.
I suppose he thought it would be treason
to Dinkie to praise the newcomers who threatened to
put little Dinkie&#8217;s nose out of joint. And Whinnie, I
imagine, will always be loyal to Dinkie. He says little
about it, but I know he loves that child. He loves him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
in very much the same way that Bobs, our collie dog,
loves me. It was really Bobs&#8217; welcome, I think, across
the cold prairie air, that took the tragedy out of my
homecoming. There were gladness and trust in those
deep-throated howls of greetings. He even licked the
snow off my overshoes and nested his head between my
knees, with his bob-tail thumping the floor like a flicker&#8217;s
beak. He sniffed at the Twins rather disgustedly.
But he&#8217;ll learn to love them, I feel sure, as time goes
on. He&#8217;s too intelligent a dog to do otherwise....
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be glad when spring comes, and takes the razor-edge
out of this northern air. We&#8217;ll have half a month
of mud first, I suppose. But &#8220;there&#8217;s never anything
without something,&#8221; as Mrs. Teetzel very sagely announced
the other day. That sour-apple philosopher,
by the way, is taking her departure to-morrow. And
I&#8217;m not half so sorry as I pretend to be. She&#8217;s made
me feel like an intruder in my own home. And she&#8217;s
a soured and venomous old ignoramus, for she sneered
openly at my bath-thermometer and defies Poppsy and
Pee-Wee to survive the winter without a &#8220;comfort.&#8221;
After I&#8217;d announced my intention of putting them
outdoors to sleep, when they were four weeks old, she
lugubriously acknowledged that there were more ways
than one of murderin&#8217; infant children. <i>Her</i> ideal along
this line, I&#8217;ve discovered, is slow asphyxiation in a sort
of Dutch-oven made of an eider-down comforter, with
as much air as possible shut off from their uncomfortable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
little bodies. But the Oracle is going, and I intend
to bring up my babies in my own way. For I know a
little more about the game now than I did when little
Dinkie made his appearance in this vale of tears. And
whatever my babies may or may not be, they are at
least healthy little tikes.

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I seem to be fitting into things again, here at Casa
Grande. I&#8217;ve got my strength back, and an appetite
like a Cree pony, and the day&#8217;s work is no longer a
terror to me. I&#8217;m back in the same old rut, I was going
to say&mdash;but it is not the same. There is a spirit
of unsettledness about it all which I find impossible to
define, an air of something impending, of something
that should be shunned as long as possible. Perhaps
it&#8217;s merely a flare-back from my own shaken nerves.
Or perhaps it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t been able to get out
in the open air as much as I used to. I am missing my
riding. And Paddy, my pinto, will give us a morning
of it, when we try to get a saddle on his scarred little
back, for it&#8217;s half a year now since he has had a bit
between his teeth.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Dinky-Dunk that I&#8217;m really worrying over,
though I don&#8217;t know why. I heard him come in very
quietly last night as I was tucking little Dinkie up in
his crib. I went to the nursery door, half hoping to
hear my lord and master sing out his old-time &#8220;Hello,
Lady-Bird!&#8221; or &#8220;Are you there, Babushka?&#8221; But instead
of that he climbed the stairs, rather heavily, and
passed on down the hall to the little room he calls his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
study, his sanctum-sanctorum where he keeps his desk
and papers and books&mdash;and the duck-guns, so that
Dinkie can&#8217;t get at them. I could hear him open the
desk-top and sit down in the squeaky Bank of England
chair.
</p>
<p>When I was sure that Dinkie was off, for good, I
tiptoed out and shut the nursery door. Even big
houses, I began to realize as I stood there in the hall,
could have their drawbacks. In the two-by-four shack
where we&#8217;d lived and worked and been happy before
Casa Grande was built there was no chance for one&#8217;s
husband to shut himself up in his private boudoir and
barricade himself away from his better-half. So I decided,
all of a sudden, to beard the lion in his den.
There was such a thing as too much formality in a
family circle. Yet I felt a bit audacious as I quietly
pushed open that study door. I even weakened in my
decision about pouncing on Dinky-Dunk from behind,
like a leopardess on a helpless stag. Something in his
pose, in fact, brought me up short.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk was sitting with his head on his hand,
staring at the wall-paper. And it wasn&#8217;t especially interesting
wall-paper. He was sitting there in a trance,
with a peculiar line of dejection about his forward-fallen
shoulders. I couldn&#8217;t see his face, but I felt sure
it was not a happy face.
</p>
<p>I even came to a stop, without speaking a word, and
shrank rather guiltily back through the doorway. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
was a relief, in fact, to find that I was able to close the
door without making a sound.
</p>
<p>When Dinky-Dunk came down-stairs, half an
hour later, he seemed his same old self. He talked and
laughed and inquired if Nip and Tuck&mdash;those are the
names he sometimes takes from his team and pins on
Poppsy and Pee-Wee&mdash;had given me a hard day of
it and explained that Francois&mdash;our man on the Harris
Ranch&mdash;had sent down a robe of plaited rabbit-skin
for them.
</p>
<p>I did my best, all the time, to keep my inquisitorial
eye from fastening itself on Dunkie&#8217;s face, for I knew
that he was playing up to me, that he was acting a
part which wasn&#8217;t coming any too easy. But he stuck
to his rôle. When I put down my sewing, because my
eyes were tired, he even inquired if I hadn&#8217;t done
about enough for one day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done about half what I ought to do,&#8221; I told
him. &#8220;The trouble is, Dinky-Dunk, I&#8217;m getting old.
I&#8217;m losing my bounce!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That made him laugh a little, though it was rather
a wistful laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Gee-Gee,&#8221; he announced, momentarily like
his old self, &#8220;whatever you lose, you&#8217;ll never lose that
undying girlishness of yours!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not so much what he said, as the mere fact
that he could say it, which sent a wave of happiness
through my maternal old body. So I made for him with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
my Australian crawl-stroke, and kissed him on both
sides of his stubbly old face, and rumpled him up, and
went to bed with a touch of silver about the edges of
the thunder-cloud still hanging away off somewhere on
the sky-line.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
<h2><i>Wednesday the Twenty-fifth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>There was indeed something wrong. I knew that
the moment I heard Dinky-Dunk come into the house.
I knew it by the way he let the storm-door swing shut,
by the way he crossed the hall as far as the living-room
door and then turned back, by the way he slowly
mounted the stairs and passed leaden-footed on to his
study. And I knew that this time there&#8217;d be no &#8220;Are
you there, Little Mother?&#8221; or &#8220;Where beest thou,
<i>Boca Chica</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I&#8217;d Poppsy and Pee-Wee safe and sound asleep in
the swing-box that dour old Whinstane Sandy had
manufactured out of a packing-case, with Francois&#8217;
robe of plaited rabbit-skin to keep their tootsies warm.
I&#8217;d finished my ironing and bathed little Dinkie and
buttoned him up in his sleepers and made him hold
his little hands together while I said his &#8220;Now-I-lay-me&#8221;
and tucked him up in his crib with his broken
mouth-organ and his beloved red-topped shoes under
the pillow, so that he could find them there first thing
in the morning and bestow on them his customary
matutinal kiss of adoration. And I was standing at
the nursery window, pretty tired in body but foolishly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
happy and serene in spirit, staring out across the
leagues of open prairie at the last of the sunset.
</p>
<p>It was one of those wonderful sunsets of the winter-end
that throw wine-stains back across this bald old
earth and make you remember that although the green
hasn&#8217;t yet awakened into life there&#8217;s release on the
way. It was a sunset with an infinite depth to its opal
and gold and rose and a whisper of spring in its softly
prolonged afterglow. It made me glad and sad all at
once, for while there was a hint of vast re-awakenings
in the riotous wine-glow that merged off into pale
green to the north, there was also a touch of loneliness
in the flat and far-flung sky-line. It seemed to recede
so bewilderingly and so oppressively into a silence and
into an emptiness which the lonely plume of smoke
from one lonely shack-chimney both crowned and accentuated
with a wordless touch of poignancy.
</p>
<p>That pennon of shack-smoke, dotting the northern
horizon, seemed to become something valorous and fine.
It seemed to me to typify the spirit of man pioneering
along the fringes of desolation, adventuring into the
unknown, conquering the untamed realms of his world.
And it was a good old world, I suddenly felt, a patient
and bountiful old world with its Browningesque old
bones set out in the last of the sun&mdash;until I heard my
Dinky-Dunk go lumbering up to his study and quietly
yet deliberately shut himself in, as I gave one last look
at Poppsy and Pee-Wee to make sure they were safely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
covered. Then I stood stock-still in the center of the
nursery, wondering whether, at such a time, I ought to
go to my husband or keep away from him.
</p>
<p>I decided, after a minute or two of thought, to
bide a wee. So I slipped quietly down-stairs and
stowed Dinkie&#8217;s overturned kiddie-car away in the
cloak-room and warned Iroquois Annie&mdash;the meekest-looking
Redskin ever togged out in the cap and apron
of domestic servitude&mdash;not to burn my fricassee of
frozen prairie-chicken and not to scorch the scones so
beloved by my Scotch-Canadian lord and master.
Then I inspected the supper table and lighted the
lamp with the Ruskin-green shade and supplanted
Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s napkin that had a coffee-stain along its
edge with a fresh one from the linen-drawer. Then,
after airing the house to rid it of the fumes from
Iroquois Annie&#8217;s intemperate griddle and carrying
Dinkie&#8217;s muddied overshoes back to the kitchen and
lighting the Chinese hall-lamp, I went to the bottom
of the stairs to call my husband down to supper.
</p>
<p>But still again that wordless feeling of something
amiss prompted me to hesitate. So instead of calling
blithely out of him, as I had intended, I went silently
up the stairs. Then I slipped along the hall and just
as silently opened his study door.
</p>
<p>My husband was sitting at his desk, confronted by
a litter of papers and letters, which I knew to be the
mail he had just brought home and flung there. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
he wasn&#8217;t looking at anything on his desk. He was
merely sitting there staring vacantly out of the window
at the paling light. His elbows were on the arms
of his Bank of England swivel-chair for which I&#8217;d
made the green baize seat-pad, and as I stared in at
him, half in shadow, I had an odd impression of history
repeating itself. This puzzled me, for a moment,
until I remembered having caught sight of him in
much the same attitude, only a few days before. But
this time he looked so tired and drawn and spineless
that a fish-hook of sudden pity tugged at my throat.
For my Dinky-Dunk sat there without moving, with
the hope and the joy of life drawn utterly out of his
bony big body. The heavy emptiness of his face, as
rugged as a relief-map in the side-light, even made me
forget the smell of the scones Iroquois Annie was vindictively
scorching down in the kitchen. He didn&#8217;t
know, of course, that I was watching him, for he
jumped as I signaled my presence by slamming the
door after stepping in through it. That jump, I
knew, wasn&#8217;t altogether due to edgy nerves. It was
also an effort at dissimulation, for his sudden struggle
to get his scattered lines of manhood together still
carried a touch of the heroic. But I&#8217;d caught a glimpse
of his soul when it wasn&#8217;t on parade. And I knew
what I knew. He tried to work his poor old harried
face into a smile as I crossed over to his side. But,
like Topsy&#8217;s kindred, it died a-borning.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; I asked
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; I asked, dropping on my
knees close beside him.
</p>
<p>Instead of answering me, he swung about in the
swivel-chair so that he more directly faced the window.
The movement also served to pull away the hand
which I had almost succeeded in capturing. Nothing,
I&#8217;ve found, can wound a real man more than pity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; I repeated. For I knew, now,
that something was really and truly and tragically
wrong, as plainly as though Dinky-Dunk had up and
told me so by word of mouth. You can&#8217;t live with a
man for nearly four years without growing into a
sort of clairvoyant knowledge of those subterranean
little currents that feed the wells of mood and temper
and character. He pushed the papers on the desk
away from him without looking at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s nothing much,&#8221; he said. But he said it
so listlessly I knew he was merely trying to lie like a
gentleman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s bad news, I want to know it, right slam-bang
out,&#8221; I told him. And for the first time he
turned and looked at me, in a meditative and impersonal
sort of way that brought the fish-hook tugging
at my thorax again. He looked at me as though some
inner part of him were still debating as to whether or
not he was about to be confronted by a woman in
tears. Then a touch of cool desperation crept up into
his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our whole apple-cart&#8217;s gone over,&#8221; he slowly and
quietly announced, with those coldly narrowed eyes
still intent on my face, as though very little and yet
a very great deal depended on just how I was going to
accept that slightly enigmatic remark. And he must
have noticed the quick frown of perplexity which
probably came to my face, for that right hand of his
resting on the table opened and then closed again, as
though it were squeezing a sponge very dry. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
got me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got me&mdash;to the last dollar!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stood up in the uncertain light, for it takes time
to digest strong words, the same as it takes time to digest
strong meat.
</p>
<p>I remembered how, during the last half-year,
Dinky-Dunk had been on the wing, hurrying over to
Calgary, and Edmonton, flying east to Winnipeg,
scurrying off to the Coast, poring over township maps
and blue-prints and official-looking letters from land
associations and banks and loan companies. I had been
called in to sign papers, with bread-dough on my
arms, and asked to witness signatures, with Dinkie on
my hip, and commanded by my absent hearth-mate
to send on certain documents by the next mail. I had
also gathered up scattered sheets of paper covered with
close-penciled rows of figures, and had felt that
Dinky-Dunk for a year back had been giving more
time to his speculations than to his home and his ranch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
I had seen the lines deepen a little on that lean and
bony face of his and the pepper-and-salt above his
ears turning into almost pure salt. And I&#8217;d missed, this
many a day, the old boyish note in his laughter and
the old careless intimacies in his talk. And being a
woman of almost ordinary intelligence&mdash;preoccupied
as I was with those three precious babies of mine&mdash;I
had arrived at the not unnatural conclusion that my
spouse was surrendering more and more to that passion
of his for wealth and power.
</p>
<p>Wealth and power, of course, are big words in the
language of any man. But I had more than an inkling
that my husband had been taking a gambler&#8217;s chance
to reach the end in view. And now, in that twilit
shadow-huddled cubby-hole of a room, it came over me,
all of a heap, that having taken the gambler&#8217;s chance,
we had met a fate not uncommon to gamblers, and had
lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re bust!&#8221; I remarked, without any great
show of emotion, feeling, I suppose, that without
worldly goods we might consistently be without elegance.
And in the back of my brain I was silently revising
our old Kansas pioneer couplet into
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>In land-booms we trusted</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And in land-booms we busted.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t a joke. You can&#8217;t have the bottom
knocked out of your world, naturally, and find an invisible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Nero blithely fiddling on your heart-strings.
And I hated to see Dinky-Dunk sitting there with that
dead look in his eyes. I hated to see him with his
spirit broken, with that hollow and haggard misery
about the jowls, which made me think of a hound-dog
mourning for a dead master.
</p>
<p>But I knew better than to show any pity for Dinky-Dunk
at such a time. It would have been effective as
a stage-picture, I know, my reaching out and pressing
his tired head against a breast sobbing with comprehension
and shaking with compassion. But pity, with
real men-folks in real life, is perilous stuff to deal in.
I was equally afraid to feel sorry for myself, even
though my body chilled with the sudden suspicion that
Casa Grande and all it held might be taken away from
me, that my bairns might be turned out of their warm
and comfortable beds, overnight, that the consoling
sense of security which those years of labor had
builded up about us might vanish in a breath. And I
needed new flannelette for the Twins&#8217; nighties, and a
reefer for little Dinky-Dunk, and an aluminum
double-boiler that didn&#8217;t leak for me maun&#8217;s porritch.
There were rafts of things I needed, rafts and rafts of
them. But here we were bust, so far as I could tell, on
the rocks, swamped, stranded and wrecked.
</p>
<p>I held myself in, however, even if it <i>did</i> take an
effort. I crossed casually over to the door, and opened
it to sniff at the smell of supper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever happens, Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I very calmly
announced, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to eat. And if that she-Indian
scorches another scone I&#8217;ll go down there and scalp
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My husband got slowly and heavily up out of the
chair, which gave out a squeak or two even when relieved
of his weight. I knew by his face in the half-light
that he was going to say that he didn&#8217;t care to
eat.
</p>
<p>But, instead of saying that, he stood looking at me,
with a tragically humble sort of contriteness. Then,
without quite knowing he was doing it, he brought his
hands together in a sort of clinch, with his face twisted
up in an odd little grimace of revolt, as though he
stood ashamed to let me see that his lip was quivering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a rotten deal,&#8221; he almost moaned, &#8220;to
you and the kiddies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll survive it,&#8221; I said with a grin that was
plainly forced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t seem to understand what it means,&#8221;
he protested. His impatience, I could see, was simply
that of a man overtaxed. And I could afford to
make allowance for it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that it&#8217;s almost an hour past supper-time,
my Lord, and that if you don&#8217;t give me a chance
to stoke up I&#8217;ll bite the edges off the lamp-shade!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was rewarded by just the ghost of a smile, a
smile that was much too wan and sickly to live long.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; announced Dinky-Dunk, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
down in a minute or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was courage in that, I saw, for all the listlessness
of the tone in which it had been uttered. So I
went skipping down-stairs and closed my baby grand
and inspected the table and twisted the glass bowl that
held my nasturtium-buds about, to the end that the
telltale word of &#8220;Salt&#8221; embossed on its side would not
betray the fact that it had been commandeered from
the kitchen-cabinet. Then I turned up the lamp and
smilingly waited until my lord and master seated himself
at the other side of the table, grateful beyond
words that we had at least that evening alone and
were not compelled to act up to a part before the eyes
of strangers.
</p>
<p>Yet it was anything but a successful meal. Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
pretense at eating was about as hollow as my
pretense at light-heartedness. We each knew that the
other was playing a part, and the time came when to
keep it up was altogether too much of a mockery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I said after a silence that was too
abysmal to be ignored, &#8220;let&#8217;s look this thing squarely
in the face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the courage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ve got to get it,&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to
face the music, if you are. So let&#8217;s get right down to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
hard-pan. Have they&mdash;have they really cleaned you
out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the last dollar,&#8221; he replied, without looking up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did it?&#8221; I asked, remaining stubbornly and
persistently ox-like in my placidity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one thing did it, Chaddie, except that I tried
to bite off too much. And for the last two years, of
course, the boom&#8217;s been flattening out. If our Associated
Land Corporation hadn&#8217;t gone under&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it <i>has</i> gone under?&#8221; I interrupted, with a
catch of the breath, for I knew just how much had
been staked on that venture.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk nodded his head. &#8220;And carried me
with it,&#8221; he grimly announced. &#8220;But even that
wouldn&#8217;t have meant a knock-out, if the government
had only kept its promise and taken over my Vancouver
Island water-front.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That, I remembered, was to have been some sort of
a shipyard. Then I remembered something else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Twins were born,&#8221; I reminded Dunkie,
&#8220;you put the ranch here at Casa Grande in my name.
Does that mean we lose our home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was able to speak quietly, but I could hear the
thud of my own heart-beats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for you to decide,&#8221; he none too happily acknowledged.
Then he added, with sudden decisiveness:
&#8220;No, they can&#8217;t touch anything of <i>yours</i>! Not a
thing!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t that hold good with the Harris Ranch,
as well?&#8221; I further inquired. &#8220;That was actually
bought in my name. It was deeded to me from the
first, and always has been in my name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s yours,&#8221; he said with a hesitation
that was slightly puzzling to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how about the cattle and things?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What cattle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cattle we&#8217;ve kept on it to escape the wild
land tax? Aren&#8217;t those all legally mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It sounded rapacious, I suppose, under the circumstances.
It must have seemed like looting on a battlefield.
But I wasn&#8217;t thinking entirely about myself,
even though poor old Dinky-Dunk evidently assumed
so, from the look of sudden questioning that came into
his stricken eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re yours,&#8221; he almost listlessly responded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as I&#8217;ve already said, let&#8217;s look this thing
fairly and squarely in the face. We&#8217;ve taken a gambler&#8217;s
chance on a big thing, and we&#8217;ve lost. We&#8217;ve
lost our pile, as they phrase it out here, but if what
you say is true, we haven&#8217;t lost our home, and what is
still more important, we haven&#8217;t lost our pride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My husband looked down at his plate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s gone, too,&#8221; he slowly admitted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound like my Dinky-Dunk, a thing like
that,&#8221; I promptly admonished. But I&#8217;d spoken before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
I caught sight of the tragic look in his eyes as he once
more looked up at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If those politicians had only kept their word, we&#8217;d
have had our shipyard deal to save us,&#8221; he said, more
to himself than to me. Yet that, I knew, was more an
excuse than a reason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the rabbit-dog hadn&#8217;t stopped to scratch,
he might have caught the hare!&#8221; I none too mercifully
quoted. My husband&#8217;s face hardened as he sat
staring across the table at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you can take it lightly enough to joke
over,&#8221; he remarked, as he got up from his chair.
There was a ponderous sort of bitterness in his voice,
a bitterness that brought me up short. I had to fight
back the surge of pity which was threatening to
strangle my voice, pity for a man, once so proud of his
power, standing stripped and naked in his weakness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven knows I don&#8217;t want to joke, Honey-Chile,&#8221;
I told him. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not the first of these wild-catting
westerners who&#8217;ve come a cropper. And since we
haven&#8217;t robbed a bank, or&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a little worse than that,&#8221; cut in Dinky-Dunk,
meeting my astonished gaze with a sort of Job-like
exultation in his own misery. I promptly asked
him what he meant. He sat down again, before speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that I&#8217;ve lost Allie&#8217;s money along with my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
own,&#8221; he very slowly and distinctly said to me. And
we sat there, staring at each other, for all the world
like a couple of penguins on a sub-Arctic shingle.
</p>
<p>Allie, I remembered, was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s English
cousin, Lady Alicia Elizabeth Newland, who&#8217;d made
the Channel flight in a navy plane and the year before
had figured in a Devonshire motor-car accident.
Dinky-Dunk had a picture of her, from <i>The Queen</i>,
up in his study somewhere, the picture of a very debonair
and slender young woman on an Irish hunter.
He had a still younger picture of her in a tweed skirt
and spats and golf-boots, on the brick steps of a Sussex
country-house, with the jaw of a bull-dog resting
across her knee. It was signed and dated and in a silver
frame and every time I&#8217;d found myself polishing that
oblong of silver I&#8217;d done so with a wifely ruffle of
temper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much was it?&#8221; I finally asked, still adhering
to my rôle of the imperturbable chorus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She sent out over seven thousand pounds. She
wanted it invested out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the new English taxes, I suppose.
She said she wanted a ranch, but she left everything
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was a trust fund!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk bowed his head, in assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It practically amounted to that,&#8221; he acknowledged.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every penny of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I began. I didn&#8217;t need to continue,
for he seemed able to read my thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was counting on two full sections for Allie in
the Simmond&#8217;s Valley tract. That land is worth thirty
dollars an acre, unbroken, at any time. But the bank&#8217;s
swept that into the bag, of course, along with the rest.
The whole thing was like a stack of nine-pins&mdash;when
one tumbled, it knocked the other over. I thought I
could manage to save that much for her, out of the
ruin. But the bank saw the land-boom was petering
out. They shut off my credit, and foreclosed on the
city block&mdash;and that sent the whole card-house down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had a great deal of thinking to do, during the
next minute or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then isn&#8217;t it up to us to knuckle down, Dinky-Dunk,
and make good on that Lady Alicia mistake?
If we get a crop this year we can&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Dinky-Dunk shook his head. &#8220;A thousand
bushels an acre couldn&#8217;t get me out of this mess,&#8221; he
maintained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because your Lady Alicia and her English maid
have already arrived in Montreal,&#8221; he quietly announced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She wrote to me from New York. She&#8217;s had influenza,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
and it left her with a wheezy tube and a spot
on her lungs, as she put it. Her doctor told her to go
to Egypt, but she says Egypt&#8217;s impossible, just now,
and if she doesn&#8217;t like our West she says she&#8217;ll amble
on to Arizona, or try California for the winter.&#8221; He
looked away, and smiled rather wanly. &#8220;She&#8217;s counting
on the big game shooting we can give her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grizzly, and buffalo, and that sort of thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s on her way out here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on her way out here to inspect a ranch which
doesn&#8217;t exist!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sat for a full minute gaping into Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
woebegone face. And still again I had considerable
thinking to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll <i>make</i> it exist,&#8221; I finally announced.
But Dinky-Dunk, staring gloomily off into space,
wasn&#8217;t even interested. They had stunned the spirit out
of him. He wasn&#8217;t himself. They&#8217;d put him where
even a well-turned Scotch scone couldn&#8217;t appeal to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; I solemnly admonished. &#8220;If this Cousin
Allie of yours is coming out here for a ranch, she&#8217;s
got to be presented with one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds easy!&#8221; he said, not without mockery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And apparently the only way we can see that she&#8217;s
given her money&#8217;s worth is to hand Casa Grande over
to her. Surely if she takes this, bag and baggage,
she ought to be half-satisfied.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk looked up at me as though I were assailing
him with the ravings of a mad-woman. He
knew how proud I had always been of that prairie
home of ours.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Casa Grande is yours&mdash;yours and the kiddies,&#8221;
he reminded me. &#8220;You&#8217;ve at least got that, and God
knows you&#8217;ll need it now, more than ever, God knows
I&#8217;ve at least kept my hands off <i>that</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see it can&#8217;t be ours, it can&#8217;t be a
home, when there&#8217;s a debt of honor between us and
every acre of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in no way involved in that debt,&#8221; cried
out my lord and master, with a trace of the old battling
light in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so involved in it that I&#8217;m going to give up
the glory of a two-story house with hardwood floors
and a windmill and a laundry chute and a real bathroom,
before that English cousin of yours can find
out the difference between a spring-lamb and a jack-rabbit!&#8221;
I resolutely informed him. &#8220;And I&#8217;m going
to do it without a whimper. Do you know what
we&#8217;re going to do, O lord and master? We&#8217;re going
to take our kiddies and our chattels and our precious
selves over to that Harris Ranch, and there we&#8217;re
going to begin over again just as we did nearly four
years ago!&#8221; Dinky-Dunk tried to stop me, but I
warned him aside. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m doing anything
romantic. I&#8217;m doing something so practical that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
more I think of it the more I see it&#8217;s the only thing
possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat looking at me as though he had forgotten
what my features were like and was, just discovering
that my nose, after all, hadn&#8217;t really been put on
straight. Then the old battling light grew stronger
than ever in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>not</i> going to be the only thing possible,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;And I&#8217;m not going to make <i>you</i> pay for
my mistakes. Not on your life! I could have swung
the farm lands, all right, even though they did have
me with my back to the wall, if only the city stuff
hadn&#8217;t gone dead&mdash;so dead that to-day you couldn&#8217;t
even give it away. I&#8217;m not an embezzler. Allie sent
me out that money to take a chance with, and by taking
a double chance I honestly thought I could get
her double returns. As you say, it was a gambler&#8217;s
chance. But the cards broke against me. The thing
that hurts is that I&#8217;ve probably just about cleaned
the girl out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; I asked, wondering why
I was finding it so hard to sympathize with that denuded
and deluded English cousin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know what&#8217;s happened to about all of
the older families and estates over there,&#8221; retorted
Dinky-Dunk. &#8220;The government has pretty well
picked them clean.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Could I see your Cousin Allie&#8217;s letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What good would it do?&#8221; asked the dour man
across the table from me. &#8220;The fat&#8217;s in the fire, and
we&#8217;ve got to face the consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve been trying to tell
you, you foolish old calvanistic autocrat! We&#8217;ve got
to face the consequences, and the only way to do it
is to do it the way I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s face softened a little, and he seemed
almost ready to smile. But he very quickly clouded
up again, just as my own heart clouded up. For I
knew, notwithstanding my willingness to deny it, that
I was once more acting on impulse, very much as I&#8217;d
acted on impulse four long years ago in that residuary
old horse-hansom in Central Park when I agreed
to marry Duncan Argyll McKail before I was even
in love with him. But, like most women, I was willing
to let Reason step down off the bridge and have
Intuition pilot me through the more troubled waters
of a life-crisis. For I knew that I was doing the
right thing, even though it seemed absurd, even
though at first sight it seemed too prodigious a sacrifice,
just as I&#8217;d done the right thing when in the face
of tribal reasoning and logic I&#8217;d gone kiting off to a
prairie-ranch and a wickiup with a leaky roof. It
was a tumble, but it was a tumble into a pansy-bed.
And I was thinking that luck would surely be with me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
a second time, though thought skidded, like a tire on
a wet pavement, every time I tried to foresee what this
newer change would mean to me and mine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to face another three years of
drudgery and shack-dirt,&#8221; declared Dinky-Dunk, following,
oddly enough, my own line of thought. &#8220;You
went through that once, and once was enough. It&#8217;s
not fair. It&#8217;s not reasonable. It&#8217;s not even thinkable.
You weren&#8217;t made for that sort of thing, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; I broke in, doing my best to speak
calmly and quietly. &#8220;Those three years were really
the happiest three years of all my life. I love to remember
them, for they mean so much more than all
the others. There were a lot of the frills and fixin&#8217;s
of life that we had to do without. But those three
years brought us closer together, Dinky-Dunk, than
we have ever been since we moved into this big house
and got on bowing terms again with luxury. I don&#8217;t
know whether you&#8217;ve given it much thought or not,
husband o&#8217; mine, but during the last year or two
there&#8217;s been a change taking place in us. You&#8217;ve
been worried and busy and forever on the wing, and
there have been days when I&#8217;ve felt you were almost a
stranger to me, as though I&#8217;d got to be a sort of accident
in your life. Remember, Honey-Chile, I&#8217;m not
blaming you; I&#8217;m only pointing out certain obvious
truths, now the time for a little honest talk seems to
have cropped up. You were up to your ears in a fight,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
in a tremendously big fight, for success and money;
and you were doing it more for me and Dinkie and
Poppsy and Pee-Wee than for yourself. You couldn&#8217;t
help remembering that I&#8217;d been a city girl and imagining
that prairie-life was a sort of penance I was undergoing
before passing on to the joys of paradise
in an apartment-hotel with a mail-chute outside the
door and the sound of the Elevated outside the windows.
And you were terribly wrong in all that, for
there have been days and days, Dinky-Dunk, when
I&#8217;ve been homesick for that old slabsided ranch-shack
and the glory of seeing you come in ruddy and hungry
and happy for the ham and eggs and bread I&#8217;d
cooked with my own hands. It seemed to bring us
so gloriously close together. It seemed so homy and
happy-go-lucky and soul-satisfying in its completeness,
and we weren&#8217;t forever fretting about bank-balances
and taxes and over-drafts. I was just a rancher&#8217;s
wife then&mdash;and I can&#8217;t help feeling that all
along there was something in that simple life we didn&#8217;t
value enough. We were just rubes and hicks and
clodhoppers and hay-tossers in those days, and we
weren&#8217;t staying awake nights worrying about land-speculations
and water-fronts and trying to make ourselves
millionaires when we might have been making
ourselves more at peace with our own souls. And now
that our card-house of high finance has gone to smash,
I realize more than ever that I&#8217;ve got to be at peace
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
with my own soul and on speaking terms with my own
husband. And if this strikes you as an exceptionally
long-winded sermon, my beloved, it&#8217;s merely to make
plain to you that I haven&#8217;t surrendered to any sudden
wave of emotionalism when I talk about migrating
over to that Harris Ranch. It&#8217;s nothing more than
good old hard-headed, practical self-preservation, for
I wouldn&#8217;t care to live without you, Dinky-Dunk, any
more than I imagine you&#8217;d care to live without your
own self-respect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sat back, after what I suppose was the longest
speech I ever made in my life, and studied my lord and
master&#8217;s face. It was not an easy map to decipher, for
man, after all, is a pretty complex animal and even in
his more elemental moments is played upon by pretty
complex forces. And if there was humility on that
lean and rock-ribbed countenance of my soul-mate
there was also antagonism, and mixed up with the antagonism
was a sprinkling of startled wonder, and
tangled up with the wonder was a slightly perplexed
brand of contrition, and interwoven with that again
was a suggestion of allegiance revived, as though he
had forgotten that he possessed a wife who had a
heart and mind of her own, who was even worth sticking
to when the rest of the world was threatening to
give him the cold shoulder. He felt abstractedly
down in his coat pocket for his pipe, which is always
a helpful sign.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big and fine of you, Chaddie, to put it that
way,&#8221; he began, rather awkwardly, and with just a
touch of color coming to his rather gray-looking
cheek-bones. &#8220;But can&#8217;t you see that now it&#8217;s the
children we&#8217;ve got to think of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>have</i> thought of them,&#8221; I quietly announced.
As though any mother, on prairie or in metropolis,
didn&#8217;t think of them first and last and in-between-whiles!
&#8220;And that&#8217;s what simplifies the situation.
I want them to have a fair chance. I&#8217;d rather they&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not quite that criminal,&#8221; cut in Dinky-Dunk,
with almost an angry flush creeping up toward his
forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only taking your own word for that,&#8221; I reminded
him, deliberately steeling my heart against
the tides of compassion that were trying to dissolve
it. &#8220;And I&#8217;m only taking what is, after all, the easiest
course out of the situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s color receded, leaving his face even
more than ever the color of old cheese, for all the
tan of wind and sun which customarily tinted it, like
afterglow on a stubbled hillside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Lady Alicia herself still has something to say
about all this,&#8221; he reminded me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Alicia had better rope in her ranch when the
roping is good,&#8221; I retorted, chilled a little by her repeated
intrusion into the situation. For I had no intention
of speaking of Lady Alicia Newland with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
bated breath, just because she had a title. I&#8217;d
scratched dances with a duke or two myself, in my
time, even though I could already see myself once more
wielding a kitchen-mop and tamping a pail against a
hog-trough, over at the Harris Ranch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re missing the point,&#8221; began Dinky-Dunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; I suddenly commanded. A harried roebuck
has nothing on a young mother for acuteness of
hearing. And thin and faint, from above-stairs, I
caught the sound of a treble wailing which was
promptly augmented into a duet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poppsy&#8217;s got Pee-Wee awake,&#8221; I announced as I
rose from my chair. It seemed something suddenly
remote and small, this losing of a fortune, before the
more imminent problem of getting a pair of crying
babies safely to sleep. I realized that as I ran upstairs
and started the swing-box penduluming back
and forth. I even found myself much calmer in spirit
by the time I&#8217;d crooned and soothed the Twins off
again. And I was smiling a little, I think, as I went
down to my poor old Dinky-Dunk, for he held out a
hand and barred my way as I rounded the table to
resume my seat opposite him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t despise me, do you?&#8221; he demanded, holding
me by the sleeve and studying me with a slightly
mystified eye. It was an eye as wistful as an old
hound&#8217;s in winter, an eye with a hunger I&#8217;d not seen
there this many a day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Despise you, Acushla?&#8221; I echoed, with a catch in
my throat, as my arms closed about him. And as he
clung to me, with a forlorn sort of desperation, a soul-Chinook
seemed to sweep up the cold fogs that had
gathered and swung between us for so many months.
I&#8217;d worried, in secret, about that fog. I&#8217;d tried to tell
myself that it was the coming of the children that had
made the difference, since a big strong man, naturally,
had to take second place to those helpless little mites.
But my Dinky-Dunk had a place in my heart which
no snoozerette could fill and no infant could usurp. He
was my man, my mate, my partner in this tangled
adventure called life, and so long as I had him they
could take the house with the laundry-chute and the
last acre of land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, my dear,&#8221; I tried to tell him, &#8220;I was
never hungry for money. The one thing I&#8217;ve always
been hungry for is love. What&#8217;d be the good of having
a millionaire husband if he looked like a man in
a hair-shirt on every occasion when you asked for a
moment of his time? And what&#8217;s the good of life if
you can&#8217;t crowd a little affection into it? I was just
thinking we&#8217;re all terribly like children in a Maypole
dance. We&#8217;re so impatient to get our colored
bands wound neatly about a wooden stick, a wooden
stick that can never be ours, that we make a mad race
of what really ought to be a careless and leisurely joy.
We don&#8217;t remember to enjoy the dancing, and we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
seem to get so mixed in our ends. So <i>carpe diem</i>,
say I. And perhaps you remember that sentence from
Epictetus you once wrote out on a slip of paper and
pinned to my bedroom door: &#8216;Better it is that great
souls should live in small habitations than that abject
slaves should burrow in great houses!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, as I sat brushing back his top-knot,
regarded me with a sad and slightly acidulated smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d need all that philosophy, and a good deal
more, before you&#8217;d lived for a month in a place like
the Harris shack,&#8221; he warned me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I knew you loved me, O Kaikobad,&#8221; I very
promptly informed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you do know that,&#8221; he contended, man-like.
I was glad to find, though, that a little of the bitterness
had gone out of his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Feather-headed women like me, Diddums, hunger
to hear that sort of thing, hunger to hear it all the
time. On that theme they want their husbands to be
like those little Japanese wind-harps that don&#8217;t even
know how to be silent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you say, about a month ago, that
marriage was like Hogan&#8217;s Alley, the deeper one got
into it the tougher it was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you go off to Edmonton for three whole
days without kissing me good-by?&#8221; I countered. I
tried to speak lightly, but it took an effort. For my
husband&#8217;s neglect, on that occasion, had seemed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
first intimation that the glory was over and done
with. It had given me about the same feeling that we
used to have as flapperettes when the circus-manager
mounted the tub and began to announce the after-concert,
all for the price of ten cents, one dime!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to, Tabbie, but you impressed me as
looking rather unapproachable that day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the honey is scarce, my dear, even bees are
said to be cross,&#8221; I reminded him. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the
thing that disturbs me, Dinky-Dunk. It must disturb
any woman to remember that she&#8217;s left her happiness
in one man&#8217;s hand. And it&#8217;s more than one&#8217;s mere
happiness, for mixed up with that is one&#8217;s sense of
humor and one&#8217;s sense of proportion. They all go,
when you make me miserable. And the Lord knows,
my dear, that a woman without a sense of humor is
worse than a dipper without a handle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk sat studying me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it was my own sense of proportion that
got out of kilter, Gee-Gee,&#8221; he finally said. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s one thing I want you to remember. If I got
deeper into this game than I should have, it wasn&#8217;t
for what money meant to me. I&#8217;ve never been able to
forget what I took you away from. I took you away
from luxury and carted you out here to the end of
Nowhere and had you leave behind about everything
that made life decent. And the one thing I&#8217;ve always
wanted to do is make good on that over-draft on your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
bank-account of happiness. I&#8217;ve wanted to give back
to you the things you sacrificed. I knew I owed you
that, all along. And when the children came I saw
that I owed it to you more than ever. I want to give
Dinky-Dink and Poppsy and Pee-Wee a fair chance
in life. I want to be able to start them right, just
as much as you do. And you can&#8217;t be dumped back
into a three-roomed wickiup, with three children to
bring up, and feel that you&#8217;re doing the right thing
by your family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t altogether happy talk, but deep down in
my heart I was glad we were having it. It seemed to
clear the air, very much as a good old-fashioned thunder-storm
can. It left us stumbling back to the essentials
of existence. It showed us where we stood,
and what we meant to each other, what we must mean
to each other. And now that the chance had come, I
intended to have my say out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The things that make life decent, Dinky-Dunk,
are the things that we carry packed away in our own
immortal soul, the homely old things like honesty and
self-respect and contentment of mind. And if we&#8217;ve
got to cut close to the bone before we can square up
our ledger of life, let&#8217;s start the carving while we have
the chance. Let&#8217;s get our conscience clear and know
we&#8217;re playing the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was dreadfully afraid he was going to laugh at
me, it sounded so much like pulpiteering. But I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
in earnest, passionately in earnest, and my lord and
master seemed to realize it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you thought about the kiddies?&#8221; he asked
me, for the second time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always thinking about the kiddies,&#8221; I told him,
a trifle puzzled by the wince which so simple a statement
could bring to his face. His wondering eye,
staring through the open French doors of the living-room,
rested on my baby grand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about <i>that</i>?&#8221; he demanded, with a grim head-nod
toward the piano.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may help to amuse Lady Alicia,&#8221; I just as
grimly retorted.
</p>
<p>He stared about that comfortable home which we
had builded up out of our toil, stared about at it as
I&#8217;ve seen emigrants stare back at the receding shores
of the land they loved. Then he sat studying my face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since you&#8217;ve seen the inside of the
Harris shack?&#8221; he suddenly asked me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last Friday when I took the bacon and oatmeal
over to Soapy and Francois and Whinstane Sandy,&#8221;
I told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you think of that shack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It impressed me as being sadly in need of soap
and water,&#8221; I calmly admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s like any other
shack where two or three men have been batching&mdash;no
better and no worse than the wickiup I came to
here on my honeymoon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk looked about at me quickly, as though
in search of some touch of malice in that statement.
He seemed bewildered, in fact, to find that I was able
to smile at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that, Chaddie, was nearly four long years
ago,&#8221; he reminded me, with a morose and meditative
clouding of the brow. And I knew exactly what he
was thinking about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know better how to go about it this time,&#8221; I
announced with my stubbornest Doctor Pangless grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are two things you haven&#8217;t taken into
consideration,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk reminded me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One is the matter of ready money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve that six hundred dollars from my Chilean nitrate
shares,&#8221; I proudly announced. &#8220;And Uncle Carlton
said that if the Company ever gets reorganized
it ought to be a paying concern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, however, didn&#8217;t seem greatly impressed
with either the parade of my secret nest-egg
or the promise of my solitary plunge into finance.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the other?&#8221; I asked as he still sat frowning
over his empty pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other is Lady Alicia herself,&#8221; he finally explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can she do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may cause complications.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of complications?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell until I&#8217;ve seen her,&#8221; was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
none too definite reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we needn&#8217;t cross that bridge until we come
to it,&#8221; I announced as I sat watching Dinky-Dunk
pack the bowl of his pipe and strike a match. It
seemed a trivial enough movement. Yet it was monumental
in its homeliness. It was poignant with a
power to transport me back to earlier and happier
days, to the days when one never thought of feathering
the nest of existence with the illusions of old age.
A vague loneliness ate at my heart, the same as a rat
eats at a cellar beam.
</p>
<p>I crossed over to my husband&#8217;s side and stood with
one hand on his shoulder as he sat there smoking.
I waited for him to reach out for my other hand. But
the burden of his troubles seemed too heavy to let him
remember. He smoked morosely on. He sat in a
sort of self-immuring torpor, staring out over what
he still regarded as the wreck of his career. So I
stooped down and helped myself to a very smoky kiss
before I went off up-stairs to bed. For the children,
I knew, would have me awake early enough&mdash;and
nursing mothers needs must sleep!

<h2><i>Thursday the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I have won my point. Dinky-Dunk has succumbed.
The migration is under way. The great trek has begun.
In plain English, we&#8217;re moving.
</p>
<p>I rather hate to think about it. We seem so like
the Children of Israel bundled out of a Promised Land,
or old Adam and Eve turned out of the Garden with
their little Cains and Abels. &#8220;We&#8217;re up against it,
Gee-Gee,&#8221; as Dinky-Dunk grimly observed. I could
see that we were, without his telling me. But I refused
to acknowledge it, even to myself. And it
wasn&#8217;t the first occasion. This time, thank heaven,
I can at least face it with fortitude, if not with relish.
I don&#8217;t like poverty. And I don&#8217;t intend to like it.
And I&#8217;m not such a hypocrite as to make a pretense
of liking it. But I do intend to show my Dinky-Dunk
that I&#8217;m something more than a household ornament,
just as I intend to show myself that I can be something
more than a breeder of children. I have given
my three &#8220;hostages to fortune&#8221;&mdash;and during the last
few days when we&#8217;ve been living, like the infant Moses,
in a series of rushes, I have awakened to the fact that
they are indeed hostages. For the little tikes, no matter
how you maneuver, still demand a big share of
your time and energy. But one finally manages, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
some way or another. Dinky-Dunk threatens to expel
me from the Mothers&#8217; Union when I work over
time, and Poppsy and Pee-Wee unite in letting me
know when I&#8217;ve been foolish enough to pass my fatigue-point.
Yet I&#8217;ve been sloughing off some of my
old-time finicky ideas about child-raising and reverting
to the peasant-type of conduct which I once so
abhorred in my Finnish Olga. And I can&#8217;t say that
either I or my family seem to have suffered much in
the process. I feel almost uncannily well and strong
now, and am a wolf for work. If nothing else happened
when our apple-cart went over, it at least broke
the monotony of life. I&#8217;m able to wring, in fact, just
a touch of relish out of all this migrational movement
and stir, and Casa Grande itself is already beginning
to remind me of a liner&#8217;s stateroom about the time the
pilot comes aboard and the donkey-engines start to
clatter up with the trunk-nets.
</p>
<p>For three whole days I simply ached to get at the
Harris Ranch shack, just to show what I could do
with it. And I realized when Dinky-Dunk and I drove
over to it in the buckboard, on a rather nippy morning
when it was a joy to go spanking along the prairie
trail with the cold air etching rosettes on your
cheek-bones, that it was a foeman well worthy of my
steel. At a first inspection, indeed, it didn&#8217;t look any
too promising. It didn&#8217;t exactly stand up on the prairie-floor
and shout &#8220;Welcome&#8221; into your ears. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
was an overturned windmill and a broken-down stable
that needed a new roof, and a well that had a pump
which wouldn&#8217;t work without priming. There was an
untidy-looking corral, and a reel for stringing up
slaughtered beeves, and an overturned Red River cart
bleached as white as a buffalo skeleton. As for the
wickiup itself, it was well-enough built, but lacking
in windows and quite unfinished as to the interior.
</p>
<p>I told Dinky-Dunk I wanted two new window-frames,
beaverboard for inside lining, and two gallons
of paint. I have also demanded a lean-to, to serve as
an extra bedroom and nursery, and a brand-new bunk-house
for the hired &#8220;hands&#8221; when they happen to
come along. I have also insisted on a covered veranda
and sleeping porch on the south side of the shack, and
fly-screens, and repairs to the chimney to stop the
range from smoking. And since the cellar, which is
merely timbered, will have to be both my coal-hole and
my storage-room, it most assuredly will have to be cemented.
I explained to Dinky-Dunk that I wanted
eave-troughs on both the shack and the stable, for the
sake of the soft-water, and proceeded to point out the
need of a new washing-machine, and a kiddie-coop for
Poppsy and Pee-Wee as soon as the weather got warm,
and a fence, hog-tight and horse-high, about my half-acre
of kitchen garden.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk sat staring at me with a wry though
slightly woebegone face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Lady-Bird, all this sort of thing takes
&#8216;rhino,&#8217; which means ready money. And where&#8217;s it going
to come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use that six hundred, as long as it lasts,&#8221; I
blithely retorted. &#8220;And then we&#8217;ll get credit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my credit is gone,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk dolorously
acknowledged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the matter with mine?&#8221; I demanded.
I hadn&#8217;t meant to hurt him, when I said that. But I
refused to be downed. And I intended to make my
ranch a success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still quite unimpaired, I suppose,&#8221; he said in
a thirty-below-zero sort of voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goose!&#8221; I said, with a brotherly pat on his drooping
shoulder. But my lord and master refused to be
cheered up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take more than optimism to carry
us through this first season,&#8221; he explained to me. &#8220;And
the only way that I can see is for me to get out and
rustle for work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of work?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind there&#8217;s a famine for, at this very moment,&#8221;
was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean being somebody else&#8217;s hired man?&#8221;
I said, aghast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hired man can get four dollars a day and board,&#8221;
retorted my husband. &#8220;And a man and team can get
nine dollars a day. We can&#8217;t keep things going without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
ready money. And there&#8217;s only one way, out here,
of getting it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk was able to laugh at the look of dismay
that came into my face. I hadn&#8217;t stopped to picture
myself as the wife of a hired &#8220;hand.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t
quite realized just what we&#8217;d descended to. I hadn&#8217;t
imagined just how much one needed working capital,
even out here on the edge of Nowhere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But never that way, Diddums!&#8221; I cried out in dismay,
as I pictured my husband bunking with a sweaty-smelling
plowing-gang of Swedes and Finns and hoboing
about the prairie with a thrashing outfit of the
Great Unwashed. He&#8217;d get cooties, or rheumatism,
or a sunstroke, or a knife between his ribs some fine
night&mdash;and then where&#8217;d I be? I couldn&#8217;t think of it.
I couldn&#8217;t think of Duncan Argyll McKail, the descendant
of Scottish kings and second-cousin to a
title, hiring out to some old skinflint of a farmer who&#8217;d
have him up at four in the morning and keep him on
the go until eight at night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what other way?&#8221; asked Dinky-Dunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave it to me,&#8221; I retorted. I made a bluff of
saying it bravely enough, but I inwardly decided that
instead of sixteen yards of fresh chintz I&#8217;d have to be
satisfied with five yards. Poverty, after all, is not a
picturesque thing. But I didn&#8217;t intend to be poor, I
protested to my troubled soul, as I went at that Harris
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Ranch wickiup, tooth and nail, while Iroquois Annie
kept an eye on Dinkie and the Twins.
</p>
<p>These same Twins, I can more than ever see, are going
to be somewhat of a brake on the wheels of industry.
I have even been feeding on &#8220;slops,&#8221; of late, to
the end that Poppsy and Pee-Wee may thrive. And
already I see sex-differences asserting themselves. Pee-Wee
is a bit of a stoic, while his sister shows a tendency
to prove a bit of a squealer. But Poppsy is
much the daintier feeder of the two. I&#8217;ll probably have
to wean them both, however, before many more weeks
slip by. As soon as we get settled in our new shack
and I can be sure of a one-cow supply of milk I&#8217;ll begin
a bottle-feed once in every twenty-four hours.
Dinky-Dunk says I ought to take a tip from the Indian
mother, who sometimes nurses her babe until he&#8217;s
two and three years old. I asked Ikkie&mdash;as Dinkie
calls Iroquois Annie&mdash;about this and Ikkie says the
teepee squaw has no cow&#8217;s milk and has to keep on the
move, so she feeds him breast-milk until he&#8217;s able to
eat meat. Ikkie informs me that she has seen a papoose
turn away from its mother&#8217;s breast to take a
puff or two at a pipe. From which I assume that the
noble Red Man learns to smoke quite early in life.
</p>
<p>Ikkie has also been enlightening me on other baby-customs of her
ancestors, explaining that it was once
the habit for a mother to name her baby for the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
thing seen after its birth. That, I told Dinky-Dunk,
was probably why there were so many &#8220;Running Rabbits,&#8221;
and &#8220;White Pups&#8221; and &#8220;Black Calfs&#8221; over on
the Reservation. And that started me maun enlarging
on the names of Indians he&#8217;d known, the most elongated
of which, he acknowledged, was probably
&#8220;The-&#8203;Man-&#8203;Who-&#8203;Gets-&#8203;Up-&#8203;In-&#8203;The-&#8203;Middle-&#8203;Of-&#8203;The-&#8203;Night-&#8203;To-&#8203;Feed-&#8203;Oats-&#8203;To-&#8203;His-&#8203;Pony,&#8221;
while the most descriptive
was &#8220;Slow-&#8203;To-&#8203;Come-&#8203;Over-&#8203;The-&#8203;Hill,&#8221; though
&#8220;Shot-&#8203;At-&#8203;Many-&#8203;Times&#8221; was not without value, and
&#8220;Long-&#8203;Time-&#8203;No-&#8203;See-&#8203;Him,&#8221; as the appellative for a
disconsolate young squaw, carried a slight hint of the
Indian&#8217;s genius for nomenclature. Another thing
mentioned by Dunkie, which has stuck in my memory,
was his running across a papoose&#8217;s grave in an Indian
burying-ground at Pincer Creek, when he was surveying,
where the Indian baby had been buried&mdash;above-ground,
of course&mdash;<i>in an old Saratoga trunk</i>. That
served to remind me of Francois&#8217; story about &#8220;Old
Sun,&#8221; who preceded &#8220;Running Rabbit&#8221;&mdash;note the
name&mdash;as chief of the Alberta Blackfoot tribe, and always
carried among his souvenirs of conquest a beautiful
white scalp, with hair of the purest gold, very
long and fine, but would never reveal how or where he
got it. Many a night, when I couldn&#8217;t sleep, I&#8217;ve
worried about that white scalp, and dramatized the circumstances
of its gathering. Who was the girl with
the long and lovely tresses of purest gold? And did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
she die bravely? And did she meet death honorably
and decently, or after the manner of certain of the
Jesuits&#8217; <i>Relations</i>?...
</p>

<p>I have had a talk with Whinnie, otherwise Whinstane
Sandy, who has been ditching at the far end of
our half-section. I explained the situation to him
quite openly, acknowledging that we were on the rocks
but not yet wrecked, and pointing out that there
might be a few months before the ghost could walk
again. And Whinstane Sandy has promised to stick.
Poor old Whinnie not only promised to stick, but volunteered
that if he could get over to Seattle or &#8217;Frisco
and raise some money on his Klondike claim our
troubles would be a thing of the past. For Whinnie,
who is an old-time miner and stampeder, is, I&#8217;m afraid,
a wee bit gone in the upper story. He dreams he has
a claim up North where there&#8217;s millions and millions in
gold to be dug out. On his moose-hide watch-guard he
wears a nugget almost half as big as a praline, a nugget
he found himself in ninety-nine, and he&#8217;d part with
his life, I believe, before he&#8217;d part with that bangle of
shiny yellow metal. In his chest of black-oak, too,
he keeps a package of greasy and dog-eared documents,
and some day, he proclaims, those papers will
bring him into millions of money.
</p>
<p>I asked Dinky-Dunk about the nugget, and he says
it&#8217;s genuine gold, without a doubt. He also says
there&#8217;s one chance in a hundred of Whinnie actually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
having a claim up in the gold country, but doubts if
the poor old fellow will ever get up to it again. It&#8217;s
about on the same footing, apparently, as Uncle Carlton&#8217;s
Chilean nitrate mines. For Whinnie had a foot
frozen, his third winter on the Yukon, and this, of
course, has left him lame. It means that he&#8217;s not a
great deal of good when it comes to working the land,
but he&#8217;s a clever carpenter, and a good cement-worker,
and can chore about milking the cows and looking
after the stock and repairing the farm implements.
Many a night, after supper, he tells us about the
Klondike in the old days, about the stampedes of ninety-eight
and ninety-nine, and the dance-halls and
hardships and gamblers and claim-jumpers. I have
always had a weakness for him because of his blind
and unshakable love for my little Dinkie, for whom he
whittles out ships and windmills and decoy-ducks.
But when I explained things to simple-minded old
Whinnie, and he offered to hand over the last of his
ready money&mdash;the money he was hoarding dollar by
dollar to get back to his hidden <i>El Dorado</i>&mdash;it brought
a lump up into my throat.
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t accept his offer, of course, but I loved
him for making it. And whatever happens, I&#8217;m going
to see that Whinnie has patches on his panties and no
holes in his socks as long as he abides beneath our
humble roof-tree. I intend to make the new bunk-house
just as homy and comfortable as I can, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Whinnie, under that new roof, won&#8217;t feel that he&#8217;s
been thrust out in the cold. But I must have my own
house for myself and my babes. Soapy Stennet, by
the way, has been paid off by Dinky-Dunk and is moving
on to the Knee-Hill country, where he says he can
get good wages breaking and seeding. Soapy, of
course, was a good man on the land, but I never took
a shine to that hard-eyed Canuck, and we&#8217;ll get along,
in some way or other, without him. For, in the language
of the noble Horatius, &#8220;I&#8217;ll find a way, or make
it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the way back to Casa Grande to-night, after a
hard day&#8217;s work, I asked Dinky-Dunk if we wouldn&#8217;t
need some sort of garage over at the Harris Ranch,
to house our automobile. He said he&#8217;d probably put
doors on the end of one of the portable granaries and
use that. When I questioned if a car of that size
would ever fit into a granary he informed me that we
couldn&#8217;t keep our big car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get seventeen hundred dollars for that boat,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to be satisfied with a tin
Lizzie, and squander less on gasoline.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So once again am I reminded that the unpardonable
crime of poverty is not always picturesque. But
I wrestled with my soul then and there, and put my
pride in my pocket and told Dinky-Dunk I didn&#8217;t
give a rip what kind of a car I rode in so long as I
had such a handsome <i>chauffeur</i>. And I reached out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and patted him on the knee, but he was too deep in his
worries about business matters, I suppose, to pay any
attention to that unseemly advance.
</p>
<p>To-night after supper, when the bairns were safely
in bed, I opened up the baby grand, intent on dying
game, whatever happened or was to happen. But my
concert wasn&#8217;t much of a success. When you do a
thing for the last time, and know it&#8217;s to be the last
time, it gives you a graveyardy sort of feeling, no
matter how you may struggle against it. And the
blither the tune the heavier it seemed to make my heart.
So I swung back to the statelier things that have come
down to us out of the cool and quiet of Time. I eased
my soul with the <i>Sonata Appassionata</i> and lost myself
in the <i>Moonlight</i> and pounded out the <i>Eroica</i>.
But my fingers were stiff and my touch was wooden&mdash;so
it was small wonder my poor lord and master
tried to bury himself in his four-day-old newspaper.
Then I tried Schubert&#8217;s <i>Rosamonde</i>, though that
wasn&#8217;t much of a success. So I wandered on through
Liszt to Chopin. And even Chopin struck me as too
soft and sugary and far-away for a homesteader&#8217;s
wife, so I sang
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;In the dead av the night, acushla,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>When the new big house is still,&#8221;&mdash;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>to see if it would shake any sign of recognition out
of my harried old Dinky-Dunk.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>As I beheld nothing more than an abstracted frown
over the tip-top edge of his paper, I defiantly swung
into <i>The Humming Coon</i>, which apparently had no
more effect than Herman Lohr. So with malice aforethought
I slowly and deliberately pounded out the
Beethoven Funeral March. I lost myself, in fact, in
that glorious and melodic wail of sorrow, merged my
own puny troubles in its god-like immensities, and was
brought down to earth by a sudden movement from
Dinky-Dunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why rub it in?&#8221; he almost angrily demanded as
he got up and left the room....
</p>
<p>But that stammering little soul-flight has done me
good. It has given me back my perspective. I refuse
to be downed. I&#8217;m still the captain of my soul.
I&#8217;m still at the wheel, no matter if we are rolling a bit.
And life, in some way, is still going to be good, still
well worth the living!

<h2><i>Wednesday the Eighth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk has had word that Lady Alicia is on
her way west. He seems to regard that event as something
very solemn, but I refuse to take seriously either
her ladyship or her arrival. To-night, I&#8217;m more worried
about Dinkie, who got at the floor-shellac with
which I&#8217;d been furbishing up the bathroom at Casa
Grande. He succeeded in giving his face and hair a
very generous coat of it&mdash;and I&#8217;m hoping against
hope he didn&#8217;t get too much of it in his little stomach.
He seems normal enough, and in fairly good spirits,
but I had to scrub his face with coal-oil, to get it clean,
and his poor little baby-skin is burnt rather pink.
</p>
<p>The winter has broken, the frost is coming out of
the ground and the mud is not adding to our joy in
life. Our last load over to the Harris shack was ferried
and tooled through a batter. On the top of it
(the <i>load</i>, and not the batter!) I placed Olie&#8217;s old
banjo, for whatever happens, we mustn&#8217;t be entirely
without music.
</p>
<p>Yesterday Dinky-Dunk got Paddy saddled and
bridled for me. Paddy bucked and bit and bolted and
sulked and tried to brush his rider off against the
corral posts. But Dinky-Dunk fought it out with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
him, and winded him, and mastered him, and made him
meek enough for me to slip up into the saddle. My
riding muscles, however, have gone flabby, and two or
three miles, for the first venture, was all I cared to
stand. But I&#8217;m glad to know that Paddy can be
pressed into service again, whenever the occasion
arises. Poor old Bobs, by the way, keeps looking at
me with a troubled and questioning eye. He seems to
know that some unsettling and untoward event is on
the way. When a coyote howled last night, far off
on the sky-line, Bobs poured out his soul in an answering
solo of misery. This morning, when I was
pretty busy, he poked his head between my knees.
I had a dozen things calling me, but I took the time
to rub his nose and brush back his ears and tell him
he was the grandest old dog on all God&#8217;s green earth.
And he repaid me with a look of adoration that put
springs under my heels for the rest of the morning,
and came and licked Pee-Wee&#8217;s bare heels, and later
Poppsy&#8217;s, when I was giving them their bath.

<h2><i>Friday the Tenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Lady Alicia has arrived. So have her trunks,
eleven in number&mdash;count &#8217;em!&mdash;trunks of queer sizes
and shapes, of pigskin and patent leather and canvas,
with gigantic buckles and straps, and all gaudily
initialed and plastered with foreign labels. Her ladyship
had to come, of course, at the very worst time
of year, when the mud was at its muckiest and the
prairie was at its worst. The trails were simply
awful, with the last of the frost coming out of the
ground and mother earth a foot-deep sponge of engulfing
stickiness. All the world seemed turned to
mud. I couldn&#8217;t go along, of course, when Dinky-Dunk
started off in the Teetzels&#8217; borrowed spring
&#8220;democrat&#8221; to meet his English cousin at the Buckhorn
station, with Whinstane Sandy and the wagon
trailing behind for the luggage.
</p>
<p>We expected a lady in somewhat delicate health,
so I sent along plenty of rugs and a foot-warmer,
and saw that the house was well heated, and the west
room bed turned down. Even a hot-water bottle stood
ready and waiting to be filled.
</p>
<p>But Lady Alicia, when she arrived with Dinky-Dunk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
just before nightfall, didn&#8217;t impress me as
very much of an invalid. She struck me more as a
very vital and audacious woman, neither young nor
old, with an odd quietness of manner to give a saber-edge
to her audacity. I could hear her laughing,
musically and not unpleasantly, at the mud-coated
&#8220;democrat,&#8221; which on its return looked a good deal
like a &#8217;dobe hut mounted on four chariot wheels. But
<i>everything</i>, for that matter, was covered with mud,
horses and harness and robes and even the blanket
in which Lady Alicia had wrapped herself. She had
done this, I could see, to give decent protection to a
Redfern coat of plucked beaver with immense reveres,
though there was mud enough on her stout tan shoes,
so unmistakably English in their common-sense solidity,
and some on her fur turban and even a splash
or two on her face. That face, by the way, has an
apple-blossom skin of which I can see she is justly
proud. And she has tourmaline eyes, with reddish
hazel specks in an iris of opaque blue, and small white
teeth and lips with a telltale curve of wilfulness about
them. She isn&#8217;t exactly girlish, but with all her
worldly wisdom she has a touch of the clinging-ivy
type which must make her inordinately appealing to
men. Her voice is soft and full-voweled, with that
habitual rising inflection characteristic of the English,
and that rather insolent drawl which in her native
land seems the final flower of unchallenged privilege.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
Her hands are very white and fastidious looking, and
most carefully manicured. She is, in fact, wonderful
in many ways, but I haven&#8217;t yet decided whether
I&#8217;m going to like her or not. Her smile strikes me
as having more glitter than warmth, and although she
is neither tall nor full-bodied, she seems to have the
power of making point take the place of weight. Yet,
oddly enough, there is an occasional air of masculine
loose-jointedness about her movements, a half-defiant
sort of slouch and swagger which would probably
carry much farther in her Old World than in our
easier-moving New World, where disdain of decorum
can not be regarded as quite such a novelty.
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until she was within the protecting door
of Casa Grande that I woke up to the fact of how
incongruous she stood on a northwest ranch. She
struck me, then, as distinctly an urban product, as
one of those lazy and silk-lined and limousiny sort
of women who could face an upholstery endurance-test
without any apparent signs of heart-failure, but
might be apt to fall down on engine-performance.
Yet I was determined to suspend all judgment, even
after I could see that she was making no particular
effort to meet me half-way, though she did acknowledge
that Dinkie, in his best bib and tucker, was a
&#8220;dawling&#8221; and even proclaimed that his complexion&mdash;due,
of course, to the floor-shellac and coal-oil&mdash;reminded
her very much of the higher-colored English
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
children. She also dutifully asked about Poppsy and
Pee-Wee, after announcing that she found the house
uncomfortably hot, and seemed surprised that Dinky-Dunk
should descend to the stabling and feeding and
watering of his own horses.
</p>
<p>She appeared rather constrained and ill-at-ease, in
fact, until Dinky-Dunk had washed up and joined us.
Yet I saw, when we sat down to our belated supper,
that the fair Allie had the abundant and honest appetite
of a healthy boy. She also asked if she might
smoke between courses&mdash;which same worried the unhappy
Dinky-Dunk much more than it did me. My
risibilities remained untouched until she languidly remarked
that any woman who had twins on the prairie
ought to get a V.C.
</p>
<p>But she automatically became, I retorted, a K.C.B.
This seemed to puzzle the cool-eyed Lady Alicia.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means a Knight Commander of the Bath,&#8221;
she said with her English literalness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; I agreed. And Dinky-Dunk had to
come to her rescue and explain the joke, like a court-interpreter
translating Cree to the circuit judge, so
that by the time he got through it didn&#8217;t seem a joke
at all and his eyes were flashing me a code-signal not
to be too hard on a tenderfoot. When, later on, Lady
Alicia looked about Casa Grande, which we&#8217;d toiled
and moiled and slaved to make like the homestead
prints in the immigration pamphlets, she languidly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
acknowledged that it was rather ducky, whatever that
may mean, and asked Dinky-Dunk if there&#8217;d be any
deer-shooting this spring. I notice, by the way, that
she calls him &#8220;Dooncan&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;Cousin
Doonk,&#8221; which strikes me as being over-intimate, seeing
he&#8217;s really her second cousin. It seems suggestive
of some hidden joke between them. And Duncan
addresses her quite openly as &#8220;Allie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This same Allie has brought a lady&#8217;s maid with her
whom she addresses, <i>more Anglico</i>, simply by her surname
of &#8220;Struthers.&#8221; Struthers is a submerged and
self-obliterating and patient-eyed woman of nearly
forty, I should say, with a face that would be both
intelligent and attractive, if it weren&#8217;t so subservient.
But I&#8217;ve a floaty sort of feeling that this same maid
knows a little more than she lets on to know, and I&#8217;m
wondering what western life will do to her. In one
year&#8217;s time, I&#8217;ll wager a plugged nickel against an
English sovereign, she&#8217;ll not be sedately and patiently
dining at second-table and murmuring &#8220;Yes, me
Lady&#8221; in that meek and obedient manner. But it
fairly took my breath, the adroit and expeditious
manner in which Struthers had that welter of luggage
unstrapped and unbuckled and warped into place and
things stowed away, even down to her ladyship&#8217;s
rather ridiculous folding canvas bathtub. In little
more than two shakes she had a shimmering litter of
toilet things out on the dresser tops, and even a nickel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
alcohol-lamp set up for brewing the apparently essential
cup of tea. It made me wish that I had a
Struthers or two of my own on the string. And that
made my thoughts go hurtling back to my old
Hortense and how we had parted at the Hotel de
L&#8217;Athenee, and to Theobald Gustav and his aunt the
Baroness, and the old lost life that seemed such years
and years away....
</p>
<p>But I promptly put the lid down on those over-disturbing
reminiscences. There should be no <i>post-mortems</i>
in this family circle, no jeremiads over what
has gone before. This is the New World and the
new age where life is too crowded for regrets. I am
a woman twenty-seven years old, married and the
mother of three children. I am the wife of a rancher
who went bust in a land-boom and is compelled to
start life over again. I must stand beside him, and
start from the bottom. I must also carry along with
me all the hopes and prospects of three small lives.
This, however, is something which I refuse to accept
as a burden and a handicap. It is a weight attached
to me, of course, but it&#8217;s only the stabilizing weight
which the tail contributes to the kite, allowing it, in
the end, to fly higher and keep steadier. It won&#8217;t
seem hard to do without things, when I think of those
kiddies of mine, and hard work should be a great and
glorious gift, if it is to give them the start in life
which they deserve. We&#8217;ll no longer quarrel, Diddums
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
and I, about whether Dinkie shall go to Harvard or
McGill. There&#8217;ll be much closer problems than that,
I imagine, before Dinkie is out of his knickers. Fate
has shaken us down to realities&mdash;and my present perplexity
is to get possession of six new milk-pans and
that new barrel-churn, not to mention the flannelette
I simply must have for the Twins&#8217; new nighties!...

<h2><i>Saturday the Eleventh</i></h2>
</div>

<p>These imperturbable English! I didn&#8217;t know
whether I should take off my hat to &#8217;em or despise
&#8217;em. They seem to come out of a different mold to
what we Americans do. Lady Alicia takes everything
as a matter of course. She seems to have accepted
one of the finest ranches west of the Peg as impassively
as an old work-horse accepts a new shoe. Even
the immensity of our western prairie-land hasn&#8217;t quite
stumped her. She acknowledged that Casa Grande
was &#8220;quaint,&#8221; and is obviously much more interested
in Iroquois Annie, the latter being partly a Redskin,
than in my humble self. I went up in her estimation
a little, however, when I coolly accepted one of her
cigarettes, of which she has brought enough to
asphyxiate an army. I managed it all right, though
it was nearly four long years since I&#8217;d flicked the ash
off the end of one&mdash;in Chinkie&#8217;s yacht going up to
Monte Carlo. But I was glad enough to drop the
bigger half of it quietly into my nasturtium window-box,
when the lady wasn&#8217;t looking.
</p>
<p>The lady in question, by the way, seems rather disappointed
to find that Casa Grande has what she
called &#8220;central heating.&#8221; About the middle of next
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
February, when the thermometer is flirting with the
forty-below mark, she may change her mind. I suppose
the lady expected to get a lodge and a deer-park
along with her new home, to say nothing of a picture
&#8217;all&mdash;open to the public on Fridays, admission one
shilling&mdash;and a family ghost, and, of course, a terrace
for the aforesaid ghost to ambulate along on moonlight
nights.
</p>
<p>But the thing that&#8217;s been troubling me, all day
long, is: Now that Lady Alicia has got her hand-made
ranch, what&#8217;s she going to do with it? I
scarcely expect her to take me into her confidence on
the matter, since she seems intent on regarding me
as merely a bit of the landscape. The disturbing
part of it all is that her aloofness is so unstudied, so
indifferent in its lack of deliberation. It makes me
feel like a bump on a log. I shouldn&#8217;t so much mind
being actively and martially snubbed, for that would
give me something definite and tangible to grow
combative over. But you can&#8217;t cross swords with a
Scotch mist.
</p>
<p>With Dinky-Dunk her ladyship is quite different.
I never see that look of mild impatience in her
opaque blue eyes when he is talking. She flatters him
openly, in fact, and a man takes to flattery, of course,
as a kitten takes to cream. Yet with all her outspokenness
I am conscious of a tremendous sense of
reservation. Already, more than once, she has given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
me a feeling which I&#8217;d find it very hard to describe,
a feeling as though we were being suspended over
peril by something very fragile. It&#8217;s the feeling you
have when you stand on one of those frail little Alpine
bridges that can sway so forebodingly with your own
weight and remind you that nothing but a rustic paling
or two separates you from the thousand-footed
abysses below your heels.
</p>
<p>But I mustn&#8217;t paint the new mistress of Casa
Grande all in dark colors. She has her good points,
and a mind of her own, and a thought or two of her
own. Dinky-Dunk was asking her about Egypt.
That country, she retorted, was too dead for her. She
couldn&#8217;t wipe out of her heart the memory of what
man had suffered along the banks of the Nile, during
the last four thousand years, what millions of men
had suffered there because of religion and war and
caste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never be happy in a country of dead races
and dead creeds and dead cities,&#8221; protested Lady
Alicia, with more emotion than I had expected. &#8220;And
those are the things that always stare me in the face
out there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This brought the talk around to the New World.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather fancy that a climate like yours up here,&#8221;
she coolly observed, &#8220;would make luxuries of furniture
and dress, and convert what should be the accidents
of life into essentials. You will always have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
to fight against nature, you know, and that makes
man attach more importance to the quest of comfort.
But when he lives in the tropics, in a surrounding
that leaves him with few desires, he has time to sit
down and think about his soul. That&#8217;s why you can
never have a great musician or a great poet in your
land of blizzards, Cousin Dooncan. You are all kept
too busy laying up nuts for the winter. You can&#8217;t
afford to turn gipsy and go off star-gazing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can if you join the I. W. W.,&#8221; I retorted.
But the allusion was lost on her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine a Shelley or a Theocritus up here
on your prairie,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;or a Marcus Aurelius
in the real-estate business in Winnipeg.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk was able to smile at this, though I
wasn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have the glory of doing things,&#8221; I contended,
&#8220;and somebody, I believe, has summed up your
Marcus Aurelius by saying he left behind him a couple
of beautiful books, an execrable son, and a decaying
nation. And we don&#8217;t intend to decay! We don&#8217;t
live for the moment, it&#8217;s true. But we live for To-morrow.
We write epics in railway lines, and instead
of working out sonnets we build new cities, and instead
of sitting down under a palm-tree and twiddling our
thumbs we turn a wilderness into a new nation, and
grow grain and give bread to the hungry world where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the gipsies don&#8217;t seem quite able to make both ends
meet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had my say out, and Lady Alicia sat looking at
me with a sort of mild and impersonal surprise. But
she declined to argue about it all. And it was just as
well she didn&#8217;t, I suppose, for I had my Irish up and
didn&#8217;t intend to sit back and see my country maligned.
</p>
<p>But on the way home to the Harris Ranch last
night, with Dinky-Dunk silent and thoughtful, and a
cold star or two in the high-arching heavens over us,
I found that my little fire of enthusiasm had burnt
itself out and those crazy lines of John Davidson kept
returning to my mind:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;After the end of all things,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>I felt very much alone in the world, and about as
cheerful as a moonstruck coyote, after those lines
had rattled in my empty brain like a skeleton in the
wind. It wasn&#8217;t until I saw the light in our wickiup
window and heard Bobs&#8217; bay of welcome through the
crystal-clear twilight that the leaden weight of desolation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
slipped off the ledge of my heart. But as I
heard that deep-noted bark of gladness, that friendly
intimation of guardianship unrelaxed and untiring,
I remembered that I had one faithful and unexacting
friend, even though it was nothing better than a dog.

<h2><i>Sunday the Twelfth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk rather surprised me to-day by asking
why I was so stand-offish with his Cousin Allie. I told
him that I wasn&#8217;t in the habit of curling up like a
kitten on a slab of Polar ice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she really likes you, Tabbie,&#8221; my husband
protested. &#8220;She wants to know you and understand
you. Only you keep intimidating her, and placing
her at a disadvantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was news to me. Lady Alicia, I&#8217;d imagined,
stood in awe of nothing on the earth beneath nor the
heavens above. She can speak very sharply, I&#8217;ve already
noticed, to Struthers, when the occasion arises.
And she&#8217;s been very calm and deliberate, as I&#8217;ve already
observed, in her manner of taking over Casa
Grande. For she <i>has</i> formally taken it over, Dinky-Dunk
tells me, and in a day or two we all have to
trek to town for the signing of the papers. She is,
apparently, going to run the ranch on her own hook,
and in her own way. It will be well worth watching.
</p>
<p>I was rather anxious to hear the particulars of the
transfer to Lady Allie, but Dinky-Dunk seemed a
little reluctant to go into details, and I didn&#8217;t intend to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
make a parade of my curiosity. I can bide my time.... Yesterday
I put on my old riding-suit, saddled
Paddy, fed the Twins to their last mouthful, and
went galloping off through the mud to help bring the
cattle over to the Harris Ranch. I was a sight, in
that weather-stained old suit and ragged toppers, even
before I got freckled and splashed with prairie-mud.
I was standing up in the stirrups laughing at Francois,
who&#8217;d had a bad slip and fallen in a puddle just
back of our old corral, when her Ladyship came out.
She must have taken me for a drunken cowboy who&#8217;d
rolled into a sheep-dip, for my nose was red and my
old Stetson sombrero was crooked on the back of my
head and even my hair was caked with mud. She
called to me, rather imperiously, so I went stampeding
up to her, and let Paddy indulge in that theatrical
stop-slide of his, on his haunches, so that it wasn&#8217;t
until his nose was within two feet of her own that
she could be quite sure she wasn&#8217;t about to be run
down.
</p>
<p>Her eyes popped a little when she saw it was a
woman on Paddy, though she&#8217;d refused to show a trace
of fear when we went avalanching down on her. Then
she studied my get-up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should rather like to ride that way,&#8221; she coolly
announced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way,&#8221; I told her, making Paddy
pirouette by pressing a heel against his short-ribs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
She meant, of course, riding astride, which must have
struck her as the final word in audacity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your pony,&#8221; next remarked Lady Alicia,
with a somewhat wistful intonation in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a brick,&#8221; I acknowledged. Then I swung
about to help Francois head off a bunch of rampaging
steers. &#8220;Come and see us,&#8221; I called back over my
shoulder. If Lady Alicia answered, I didn&#8217;t have time
to catch what she said.
</p>
<p>But that romp on Paddy has done me good. It
shook the solemnity out of me. I&#8217;ve just decided
that I&#8217;m not going to surrender to this middle-aged
Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire stuff before my time. I&#8217;m going
to refuse to grow old and poky. I&#8217;m going to
keep the spark alive, the sacred spark of youth, even
though folks write me down as the biggest loon west
of the Dirt Hills. So dear Lord&mdash;this is my prayer&mdash;whatever
You do to me, keep me <i>alive</i>. O God, don&#8217;t
let me, in Thy divine mercy, be a Dead One. Don&#8217;t
let me be a soured woman with a self-murdered soul.
Keep the wine of youth in my body and the hope of
happiness in my heart. Yea, permit me deeply to live
and love and laugh, so that youth may abide in my
bones, even as it did in that once-renowned Duchess
of Lienster,

<p>My poor old Dinky-Dunk, by the way, meanders
about these days so moody and morose it&#8217;s beginning
to disturb me. He&#8217;s at the end of his string, and
picked clean to the bone, and I&#8217;m beginning to see
that it&#8217;s my duty to buoy that man up, to nurse him
back into a respectable belief in himself. His nerves
are a bit raw, and he&#8217;s not always responsible for his
manners. The other night he came in tired, and tried
to read, when Poppsy and Pee-Wee were both going
it like the Russian Balalaika. To tell the truth, their
little tummies were a bit upset, because the food purveyor
had had too strenuous a day to be regular in her
rounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you keep those squalling brats quiet?&#8221;
Dinky-Dunk called out to me. It came like a thunder
clap. It left me gasping, to think that he could
call his own flesh and blood &#8220;squalling brats.&#8221; And
I was shocked and hurt, but I decided not to show it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will somebody kindly page Lord Chesterfield?&#8221;
I quietly remarked as I went to the Twins and wheeled
them out to the kitchen, where I gave them hot peppermint
and rubbed their backs and quieted them
down again.
</p>
<p>I suppose there&#8217;s no such thing as a perfect husband.
That&#8217;s a lesson we&#8217;ve all got to learn, the same
as all children, apparently, have to find out that acorns
and horse-chestnuts aren&#8217;t edible. For the nap wears
off men the same as it does off clothes. I dread to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
have to write it down, but I begin to detect thinnesses
in Dinky-Dunk, and a disturbing little run or two in
the even web of his character. But he knows when he&#8217;s
played Indian and attempts oblique and rather shamefaced
efforts to make amends, later on, when it won&#8217;t
be too noticeable. Last night, as I sat sewing, our
little Dinkie must have had a bad dream, for he wakened
from a sound sleep with a scream of terror.
Dinky-Dunk went to him first, and took him up and
sang to him, and when I glanced in I saw a rumply
and tumbly and sleepy-eyed tot with his kinky head
against his father&#8217;s shoulder. As I took up my sewing
again and heard Dinky-Dunk singing to his son,
it seemed a proud and happy and contented sort of
voice. It rose and fell in that next room, in a sort
of droning bass, and for the life of me I can&#8217;t tell why,
but as I stopped in my sewing and sat listening to that
father singing to his sleepy-eyed first-born, it brought
the sudden tears to my eyes. It has been a considerable
length of time, <i>en passant</i>, since I found myself
sitting down and pumping the brine. I must be getting
hardened in my old age.

</div>

<p>Lady Allie sent over for Dinky-Dunk yesterday
morning, to fix the windmill at Casa Grande. They&#8217;d
put it out of commission in the first week, and emptied
the pressure-tank, and were without water, and were
as helpless as a couple of canaries. We have a broken
windmill of our own, right here at home, but Diddums
went meekly enough, although he was in the midst of
his morning work&mdash;and work is about to loom big over
this ranch, for we&#8217;re at last able to get on the land.
And the sooner you get on the land, in this latitude,
the surer you are of your crop. We daren&#8217;t shave
down any margins of chance. We need that
crop....
</p>
<p>I am really beginning to despair of Iroquois Annie.
She is the only thing I can get in the way of hired
help out here, and yet she is hopeless. She is sullen
and wasteful, and she has never yet learned to be
patient with the children. I try to soften and placate
her with the gift of trinkets, for there is enough Redskin
in her to make her inordinately proud of anything
with a bit of flash and glitter to it. But she is
about as responsive to actual kindness as a diamond-back
rattler would be, and some day, if she drives
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
me too far, I&#8217;m going off at half-cock and blow that
breed into mince-meat.
</p>
<p>By the way, I can see myself writ small in little
Dinkie, my moods and waywardnesses and wicked impulses,
and sudden chinooks of tenderness alternating
with a perverse sort of shrinking away from love itself,
even when I&#8217;m hungering for it. I can also
catch signs of his pater&#8217;s masterfulness cropping out
in him. Small as he is, he disturbs me by that combative
stare of his. It&#8217;s almost a silent challenge I
see in his eyes as he coolly studies me, after a proclamation
that he will be spanked if he repeats a given
misdeed.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m beginning to understand the meaning of that
very old phrase about one&#8217;s chickens coming home to
roost. I can even detect sudden impulses of cruelty
in little Dinkie, when, young and tender as he appears
to the casual eye, a quick and wilful passion to hurt
something takes possession of him. Yesterday I
watched him catch up his one-eyed Teddy Bear, which
he loves, and beat its head against the shack-floor.
Sometimes, too, he&#8217;ll take possession of a plate and
fling it to the floor with all his force, even though
he knows such an act is surely followed by punishment.
It&#8217;s the same with Poppsy and Pee-Wee, with whom
he is apt to be over-rough, though his offenses in that
direction may still be touched with just a coloring of
childish jealousy, long and arduously as I struggle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
to implant some trace of fraternal feeling in his anarchistic
little breast. There are even times, after
he&#8217;s been hugging my knees or perhaps stroking my
cheek with his little velvet hands and murmuring
&#8220;Maaa-maa!&#8221; in his small and bird-like coo, when he
will suddenly turn savage and try to bite my patella
or pull my ear out by the root.
</p>
<p>Most of this cruelty, I think, is born of a sheer
excess of animal spirits. But not all of it. Some of
it is based on downright wilfulness. I have seen
him do without things he really wanted, rather than
unbend and say the necessary &#8220;Ta-ta&#8221; which stands
for both &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thanks&#8221; in his still limited
vocabulary. The little Hun will also fall on his picture-books,
at times, and do his best to tear the linen
pages apart, flailing them about in the air with genuine
Berserker madness. But along with this, as I&#8217;ve
already said, he has his equally sudden impulses of
affection, especially when he first wakens in the morning
and his little body seems to be singing with the
pure joy of living. He&#8217;ll smooth my hair, after I&#8217;ve
lifted him from the crib into my bed, and bury his face
in the hollow of my neck and kiss my cheek and pat my
forehead and coo over me until I squeeze him so hard
he has to grunt. Then he&#8217;ll probably do his best to
pick my eyes out, if I pretend to be asleep, or experiment
with the end of my nose, to see why it doesn&#8217;t
lift up like a door-knocker. Then he&#8217;ll snuggle down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
in the crook of my arm, perfectly still except for the
wriggling of his toes against my hip, and croon there
with happiness and contentment, like a ring-neck
dove.

</div>

<p>Lady Allie couldn&#8217;t have been picked quite clean to
the bone by the McKails, for she&#8217;s announced her intention
of buying a touring-car and a gasoline-engine
and has had a conference with Dinky-Dunk on the
matter. She also sent to Montreal for the niftiest
little English sailor suit, for Dinkie, together with a
sailor hat that has &#8220;Agamemnon&#8221; printed in gold
letters on its band.
</p>
<p>I ought to be enthusiastic about it, but I can&#8217;t.
Dinkie himself, however, who calls it his &#8220;new nailor
nuit&#8221;&mdash;not being yet able to manage the sibilants&mdash;struts
about in it proud as a peacock, and refuses to
sit down in his supper-chair until Ikkie has carefully
wiped off the seat of the same, to the end that the beloved
nailor nuit might remain immaculate. He&#8217;ll lose
his reverence for it, of course, when he knows it better.
It&#8217;s a habit men have, big or little.
</p>
<p>Lady Allie has confessed that she is succumbing to
the charm of prairie life. It ought to make her more
of a woman and less of a silk-lined idler. Dinky-Dunk
still nurses the illusion that she is delicate, and
manages to get a lot of glory out of that clinging-vine
pose of hers, big oak that he is! But it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
simply absurd, the way he falls for her flattery.
She&#8217;s making him believe that he&#8217;s a twentieth-century
St. Augustine and a Saint Christopher all rolled into
one. Poor old Dinky-Dunk, I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye
on him or they&#8217;ll be turning his head, for all its gray
hairs. He is wax in the hand of designing beauty,
as are most of the race of man. And the fair Allie,
I must acknowledge, is dangerously appealing to the
eye. It&#8217;s no wonder poor old Dinky-Dunk nearly
broke his neck trying to teach her to ride astride.
But I intend to give her ladyship an inkling, before
long, that I&#8217;m not quite so stupid as I seem to be.
She mustn&#8217;t imagine she can &#8220;vamp&#8221; my Kaikobad
with impunity. It&#8217;s a case of any port in a storm, I
suppose, for she has to practise on somebody. But I
must say she looks well on horseback and can lay
claim to a poise that always exacts its toll of respect.
She rides hard, though I imagine she would be unwittingly
cruel to her mount. Yet she has been more
offhanded and friendly, the last two or three times
she has dropped over to the shack, and she is kind
to the kiddies, especially Dinkie. She seems genuinely
and unaffectedly fond of him. As for me, she thinks
I&#8217;m hard, I feel sure, and is secretly studying me&mdash;trying
to decipher, I suppose, what her sainted cousin
could ever see in me to kick up a dust about!
</p>
<p>Lady Allie&#8217;s London togs, by the way, make me
feel rather shoddy and slattern. I intend to swing in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
a little stronger for personal adornment, as soon as
we get things going again. When a woman gives up,
in that respect, she&#8217;s surely a goner. And I may be
a hard-handed and slabsided prairie huzzy, but there
was a time when I stood beside the big palms by the
fountain in the conservatory of Prince Ernest de
Ligne&#8217;s Brussels house in the <i>Rue Montoyer</i> and the
Marquis of What-Ever-His-Name-Was bowed and set
all the orders on his chest shaking when he kissed
my hand and proclaimed that I was the most beautiful
woman in Belgium!
</p>
<p>Yes, there was such a time. But it was a long,
long time ago, and I never thought then I&#8217;d be a rancher&#8217;s
wife with a barrel-churn to scald out once a
week and a wheezy old pump to prime in the morning
and a little hanging garden of Babylon full of babies
to keep warm and to keep fed and to keep from falling
on their boneless little cocos! I might even have
married Theobald Gustav von Brockdorff and turned
into an embassy ball lizard and ascended into the old
family landau of his aunt the baroness, to disport
along the boulevards therein very much like an oyster
on the half-shell. I might have done all that, and I
might not. But it&#8217;s all for the best, as the greatest
pessimist who ever drew the breath of life once tried
to teach in his <i>Candide</i>. And in my career, as I have
already written, there shall be no jeremiads.

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to keep tab on the Twins&#8217; weight,
for it&#8217;s important that they should gain according to
schedule. But I&#8217;ve only Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s bulky grain-scales,
and it&#8217;s impossible to figure down to anything
as fine as ounces or even quarter-pounds on such a
balancer. Yet my babies, I&#8217;m afraid, are not gaining
as they ought. Poppsy is especially fretful of late.
Why can&#8217;t somebody invent children without colic,
anyway? I have a feeling that I ought to run on low
gear for a while. But that&#8217;s a luxury I can&#8217;t quite
afford.
</p>
<p>Last night, when I was dead-tired and trying to
give the last licks to my day&#8217;s work without doing a
Keystone fall over the kitchen table, Dinky-Dunk
said: &#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you ever given a name to this
new place? They tell me you have a genius for naming
things&mdash;and here we are still dubbing our home
the Harris shack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it ought to be an Indian name, in honor
of Ikkie?&#8221; I suggested, doing my best to maintain
an unruffled front. And Duncan Argyll absently
agreed that it might just as well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the matter with calling it Alabama?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
I mordantly suggested. &#8220;For as I remember it, that
means &#8216;Here we rest.&#8217; And I can imagine nothing
more appropriate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was half-sorry I said it, for the Lord deliver me
always from a sarcastic woman. But I&#8217;ve a feeling
that the name is going to stick, whether we want it
or not. At any rate, Alabama Ranch has rather a
musical turn to it....
</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any really perfect children
in the world? Or do the good little boys and girls
only belong to that sentimentalized mid-Victorian
fiction which tried so hard to make the world like a
cross between an old maid&#8217;s herb-garden and a Sunday
afternoon in a London suburb? I have tried talking
with little Dinkie, and reasoning with him. I have
striven long and patiently to blow his little spark of
conscience into the active flame of self-judgment.
And averse as I am to cruelty and hardness, much as
I hate the humiliation of physical punishment, my
poor kiddie and I can&#8217;t get along without the slipper.
I have to spank him, and spank him soundly, about
once a week. I&#8217;m driven to this, or there&#8217;d be no sleep
nor rest nor roof about our heads at Alabama Ranch.
I don&#8217;t give a rip what Barrie may have written about
the bringing up of children&mdash;for he never had any of
his own! He never had an imperious young autocrat
to democratize. He never had a family to de-barbarize,
even though he did write very pretty books about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
the subject. It&#8217;s just another case, I suppose, where
fiction is too cowardly or too finicky to be truthful.
I had theories about this child-business myself, at one
time, but my pipe of illusion has plumb gone out.
It wasn&#8217;t so many years ago that I imagined about all
a mother had to do was to dress in clinging <i>negligees</i>,
such as you see in the toilet-soap advertisements, and
hold a spotless little saint on her knee, or have a miraculously
docile nurse in cap and apron carry in a little
paragon all done up in dotted Swiss and rose-pink,
and pose for family groups, not unlike popular prints
of the royal family in full evening dress, on <i>Louis
Quinze</i> settees. And later on, of course, one could
ride out with a row of sedate little princelings at one&#8217;s
side, so that one could murmur, when the world marveled
at their manners, &#8220;It&#8217;s blood, my dears, merely
blood!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But fled, and fled forever, are all such dreams.
Dinkie prefers treading on his bread-and-butter before
consuming it, and does his best to consume the workings
of my sewing-machine, and pokes the spoons
down through the crack in the kitchen floor, and betrays
a weakness for yard-mud and dust in preference
to the well-scrubbed boards of the sleeping porch,
which I&#8217;ve tried to turn into a sort of nursery by day.
Most fiction, I find, glides lightly over this eternal
Waterloo between dirt and water&mdash;for no active and
healthy child is easy to keep clean. That is something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
which you never, never, really succeed at. All that
you can do is to keep up the struggle, consoling
yourself with the memory that cleanness, even surgical
cleanness, is only an approximation. The plain everyday
sort of cleanness promptly resolves itself into a
sort of neck and neck race with dirt and disorder, a
neck and neck race with the soap-bar habitually running
second. Sometimes it seems hopeless. For it&#8217;s
incredible what can happen to an active-bodied boy
of two or three years in one brief but crowded afternoon.
It&#8217;s equally amazing what can happen to a
respectably furnished room after a healthy and high-spirited
young Turk has been turned loose in it for an
hour or two.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a battle, all right. But it has its compensations.
It <i>has</i> to, or the race would wither up like an
unwatered cucumber-vine. Who doesn&#8217;t really love to
tub a plump and dimpled little body like my Dinkie&#8217;s?
I&#8217;m no petticoated Paul Peel, but I can see enough
beauty in the curves of that velvety body to lift it up
and bite it on its promptly protesting little flank.
And there&#8217;s unclouded glory in occasionally togging
him out in spotless white, and beholding him as immaculate
as a cherub, if only for one brief half-hour.
It&#8217;s the transiency of that spotlessness, I suppose,
which crowns it with glory. If he was forever in that
condition, we&#8217;d be as indifferent to it as we are to immortelles
and wax flowers. If he was always cherubic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
and perfect, I suppose, we&#8217;d never appreciate that
perfection or know the joy of triumphing over the
mother earth that has an affinity for the finest of us.
</p>
<p>But I <i>do</i> miss a real nursery, in more ways than
one. The absence of one gives Dinkie the range of the
whole shack, and when on the range he&#8217;s a timber-wolf
for trouble, and can annoy his father even more
than he can me by his depredations. Last night after
supper I heard an icy voice speaking from the end of
the dining-room where Dinky-Dunk has installed his
desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you kindly come and see what your son has
done?&#8221; my husband demanded, with a sort of in-this-way-madness-lies
tone.
</p>
<p>I stepped in through the kitchen door, ignoring
the quite unconscious humor of &#8220;<i>my</i> son&#8221; under the
circumstances, and found that Dinkie had provided a
novel flavor for his dad by emptying the bottle of ink
into his brand-new tin of pipe-tobacco. There was
nothing to be done, of course, except to wash as much
of the ink as I could off Dinkie&#8217;s face. Nor did I reveal
to his father that three days before I had carefully
compiled a list of his son and heir&#8217;s misdeeds,
for one round of the clock. They were, I find, as follows:
</p>
<p>Overturning a newly opened tin of raspberries,
putting bread-dough in his ears; breaking my nail-buffer,
which, however, I haven&#8217;t used for a month
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
and more; paring the bark, with the bread-knife, off
the lonely little scrub poplar near the kitchen door, our
one and only shade; breaking a drinking-glass, which
was accident; cutting holes with the scissors in Ikkie&#8217;s
new service-apron; removing the covers from two of
his father&#8217;s engineering books; severing the wire joint
in my sewing-machine belt (expeditiously and secretly
mended by Whinnie, however, when he came in with
the milk-pails); emptying what was left of my bottle
of vanilla into the bread mixer; and last but not least,
trying to swallow and nearly choking on my silver
thimble, in which he seems to find never-ending disappointment
because it will not remain fixed on the
point of his nose.
</p>
<p>It may sound like a busy day, but it was, on the
whole, merely an average one. Yet I&#8217;ll wager a
bushel of number one Northern winter wheat to a
doughnut ring that if Ibsen had written an epilogue
for <i>The Doll&#8217;s House</i>, Nora would have come crawling
back to her home and her kiddies, in the end.

<p>Lady Allie is either dunderheaded or designing.
She has calmly suggested that her rural phone-line
be extended from Casa Grande to Alabama Ranch
so that she can get in touch with Dinky-Dunk when
she needs his help and guidance. Even as it is, he&#8217;s
called on about five times a week, to run to the help
of that she-remittance-man in corduroy and dog-skin

says she&#8217;s sure to be imposed on, and that although
she&#8217;s as green as grass, she&#8217;s really anxious to
learn. He feels that it&#8217;s his duty to stand between her
and the outsiders who&#8217;d be only too ready to impose
on her ignorance.
</p>
<p>She rode over to see the Twins yesterday, who were
sleeping out under the fly-netting I&#8217;d draped over
them, the pink-tinted kind they put over fruit-baskets
in the city markets and shops. Poppsy and Pee-Wee
looked exactly like two peaches, rosy and warm and
round.
</p>
<p>Lady Allie stared at them with rather an abstracted
eye, and then, idiot that she is, announced that she&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
like to have twelve. But talk is cheap. The modern
woman who&#8217;s had even half that number has pretty
well given up her life to her family. It&#8217;s remarkable,
by the way, the silent and fathomless pity I&#8217;ve come
to have for childless women. The thought of a fat
spinster fussing over a French poodle or a faded
blond forlornly mothering a Pekinese chow gives me
a feeling that is at least first cousin to sea-sickness.
</p>
<p>Lady Allie, I find, has very fixed and definite theories
as to the rearing of children. They should never
be rocked or patted, or be given a &#8220;comfort,&#8221; and they
should be in bed for the night at sundown. There was
a time I had a few theories of my own, but I&#8217;ve pretty
well abandoned them. I&#8217;ve been taught, in this respect,
to travel light, as the overland voyageurs of this
country would express it, to travel light and leave the
final resort to instinct.

<h2><i>Friday the Twenty-fourth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I was lazy last night, so both the ink-pot and its
owner had a rest. Or perhaps it wasn&#8217;t so much laziness
as wilful revolt against the monotony of work, for,
after all, it&#8217;s not the &#8217;unting as &#8217;urts the &#8217;osses, but
the &#8217;ammer, &#8217;ammer, &#8217;ammer on the &#8217;ard old road!
I loafed for a long time in a sort of sit-easy torpor,
with Bobs&#8217; head between my knees while Dinky-Dunk
pored over descriptive catalogues about farm-tractors,
for by hook or by crook we&#8217;ve got to have a tractor for
Alabama Ranch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobs,&#8221; I said after studying my collie&#8217;s eyes for
a good many minutes, &#8220;you are surely one grand old
dog!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon Bobs wagged his tail-stump with
sleepy content. As I bent lower and stared closer
into those humid eyes of his, it seemed as though I
were staring down into a bottomless well, through a
peep-hole into Infinity, so deep and wonderful was
that eye, that dusky pool of love and trust. It was
like seeing into the velvet-soft recesses of a soul. And
I could stare into them without fear, just as Bobs
could stare back without shame. That&#8217;s where dogs
are slightly different from men. If I looked into a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
man&#8217;s eye like that he&#8217;d either rudely inquire just what
the devil I was gaping at or he&#8217;d want to ask me out
to supper in one of those Pompeian places where a
bald-headed waiter serves lobsters in a <i>chambre particulière</i>.
</p>
<p>But all I could see in the eye of my sedate old Bobs
was love, love infinite and inarticulate, love too big
ever to be put into words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I said, interrupting my lord and
master at his reading, &#8220;if God is really love, as the
Good Book says, I don&#8217;t see why they ever started
talking about the Lamb of God.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221; asked Diddums, not much
interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because lambs may be artless and innocent little
things, but when you&#8217;ve got their innocence you&#8217;ve
got about everything. They&#8217;re not the least bit intelligent,
and they&#8217;re self-centered and self-immured.
Now, with dogs it&#8217;s different. Dogs love you and
guard you and ache to serve you.&#8221; And I couldn&#8217;t
help stopping to think about the dogs I&#8217;d known and
loved, the dogs who once meant so much in my life:
Chinkie&#8217;s Bingo, with his big baptizing tongue and
his momentary rainbow as he emerged from the water
and shook himself with my stick still in his mouth;
Timmie with his ineradicable hatred for cats; Maxie
with all his tricks and his singsong of howls when the
piano played; Schnider, with his mania for my slippers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and undies, which he carried into most unexpected
quarters; and Gyp, God bless him, who was so homely
of face and form but so true blue in temper and trust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Life, to a dog,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;really means devotion
to man, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you driving at, anyway?&#8221; asked Dinky-Dunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just wondering,&#8221; I said as I sat staring
into Bobs&#8217; eyes, &#8220;how strange it would be if, after
all, God was really a dog, the loving and faithful
Watch-Dog of His universe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be blasphemous,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk coldly
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not blasphemous,&#8221; I tried to tell him.
&#8220;And I was never more serious in my life. There&#8217;s
even something sacred about it, once you look at it in
the right way. Just think of the Shepherd-Dog of
the Stars, the vigilant and affectionate Watcher who
keeps the wandering worlds in their folds! That&#8217;s not
one bit worse than the lamb idea, only we&#8217;ve got so
used to the lamb it doesn&#8217;t shock us into attention any
more. Why, just look at these eyes of Bobs right
now. There&#8217;s more nobility and devotion and trust
and love in them than was ever in all the eyes of all
the lambs that ever frisked about the fields and sheep-folds
from Dan to Beersheba!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your theory, I believe, is entertained by the Igorrotes,&#8221;
remarked Dinky-Dunk as he made a pretense
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of turning back to his tractor-pamphlet. &#8220;The Igorrotes
and other barbarians,&#8221; he repeated, so as to be
sure the screw was being turned in the proper direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I know why she said the more she knew
about men the better she liked dogs,&#8221; I just as coldly
remarked, remembering Madame de Stael. &#8220;And I
believe you&#8217;re jealous of poor old Bobs just because he
loves me more than you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk put down his pamphlet. Then he
called Bobs over to his side of the table. But Bobs,
I noticed, didn&#8217;t go until I&#8217;d nodded approval. So
Dinky-Dunk took his turn at sitting with Bobs&#8217; nose
in his hand and staring down into the fathomless
orbs that stared up at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never get a lady, me lud, to look up at you
like that,&#8221; I told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they have,&#8221; retorted Dinky-Dunk, with
his face slightly averted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And having done so in the past, there&#8217;s the natural
chance that they&#8217;ll do so in the future,&#8221; I retorted,
making it half a question and half a statement. But
he seemed none too pleased at that thrust, and he
didn&#8217;t even answer me when I told him I supposed I
was his Airedale, because they say an Airedale is a
one-man dog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t at least get distemper,&#8221; observed my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Kaikobad, very quietly, over the top of his tractor-catalogue.
</p>
<p>I made no sign that I had heard him. But Dinky-Dunk
would never have spoken to me that way, three
short years ago. And I imagine he knows it. For,
after all, a change has been taking place, insubstantial
and unseen and subterranean, a settling of the foundations
of life which comes not only to a building as it
grows older but also to the heart as it grows older.
And I&#8217;m worried about the future.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
<h2><i>Monday the&mdash;Monday the I-forget-what</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s Monday, blue Monday, that&#8217;s all I remember,
except that there&#8217;s a rift in the lute of life at Alabama
Ranch. Yesterday of course was Sunday. And out
of that day of rest Dinky-Dunk spent just five hours
over at Casa Grande. When he showed up, rather
silent and constrained and an hour and a half late for
dinner, I asked him what had happened.
</p>
<p>He explained that he&#8217;d been adjusting the carbureter
on Lady Alicia&#8217;s new car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Duncan,&#8221; I said, trying to speak
calmly, though I was by no means calm inside, &#8220;that
it&#8217;s rather a sacrifice of dignity, holding yourself at
that woman&#8217;s beck and call?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We happen to be under a slight debt of obligation
to <i>that woman</i>,&#8221; my husband retorted, clearly
more upset than I imagined he could be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dinky-Dunk, you&#8217;re not her hired man,&#8221; I
protested, wondering how, without hurting him, I
could make him see the thing from my standpoint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but that&#8217;s about what I&#8217;m going to become,&#8221;
was his altogether unexpected answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I quite understand you,&#8221; I told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
him, with a sick feeling which I found it hard to keep
under. Yet he must have noticed something amusingly
tragic in my attitude, for he laughed, though
it wasn&#8217;t without a touch of bitterness. And laughter,
under the circumstances, didn&#8217;t altogether add to
my happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply mean that Allie&#8217;s made me an offer of a
hundred and fifty dollars a month to become her ranch-manager,&#8221;
Dinky-Dunk announced with a casualness
that was patently forced. &#8220;And as I can&#8217;t wring
that much out of this half-section, and as I&#8217;d only
be four-flushing if I let outsiders come in and take
everything away from a tenderfoot, I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And such a lovely tenderfoot,&#8221; I interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;I don&#8217;t see why it isn&#8217;t the decent and reasonable
thing,&#8221; concluded my husband, without stooping
to acknowledge the interruption, &#8220;to accept that
offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I understood, in a way, every word he was saying;
yet it seemed several minutes before the real meaning
of a somewhat startling situation seeped through to
my brain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, if we get a crop,&#8221; I began. It was,
however, a lame beginning. And like most lame beginnings,
it didn&#8217;t go far.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we going to get a crop when we can&#8217;t
even raise money enough to get a tractor?&#8221; was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
challenge. &#8220;When we haven&#8217;t help, and we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
short of seed-grain, and we can&#8217;t even get a gang-plow
on credit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t sound like my Dinky-Dunk of old, for I
knew that he was equivocating and making excuses,
that he was engineering our ill luck into an apology
for worse conduct. But I was afraid of myself, even
more than I was afraid of Dinky-Dunk. And the
voice of Instinct kept whispering to me to be patient.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we sell off some of the steers?&#8221; I
valiantly suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the wrong season for selling steers,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk
replied with a ponderous sort of patience. &#8220;And
besides, those cattle don&#8217;t belong to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then whose are they?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re yours,&#8221; retorted Dinky-Dunk, and I
found his hair-splitting, at such a time, singularly
exasperating.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather imagine they belonged to the family, if
you intend it to remain a family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He winced at that, as I had proposed that he should.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be getting a dangerously divided one,&#8221;
he flung back, with a quick and hostile glance in my
direction.
</p>
<p>I was ready to fly to pieces, like a barrel that&#8217;s lost
its hoops. But a thin and quavery and over-disturbing
sound from the swing-box out on the sleeping-porch
brought me up short. It was a pizzicato note
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
which I promptly recognized as the gentle Pee-Wee&#8217;s
advertisement of wakefulness. So I beat a quick and
involuntary retreat, knowing only too well what I&#8217;d
have ahead of me if Poppsy joined in to make that
solo a duet.
</p>
<p>But Pee-Wee refused to be silenced, and what
Dinky-Dunk had just said felt more and more like a
branding-iron against my breast. So I carried my
wailing infant back to the dinner-table where my husband
still stood beside his empty chair. The hostile
eye with which he regarded the belcantoing Pee-Wee
reminded me of the time he&#8217;d spoken of his own off-spring
as &#8220;squalling brats.&#8221; And the memory wasn&#8217;t
a tranquillizing one. It was still another spur roweling
me back to the ring of combat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve decided to take that position?&#8221; I
demanded as I surveyed the cooling roast-beef and the
fallen Yorkshire pudding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as they can fix up my sleeping-quarters
in the bunk-house over at Casa Grande,&#8221; was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
reply. He tried to say it casually, but didn&#8217;t
quite succeed, for I could see his color deepen a little.
And this, in turn, led to a second only too obvious gesture
of self-defense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My monthly check, of course, will be delivered to
you,&#8221; he announced, with an averted eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why to me?&#8221; I coldly inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be of much use to me,&#8221; he retorted.
And I resented his basking thus openly in the fires of
martyrdom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;what satisfaction are you
getting out of your new position?&#8221;
</p>
<p>That sent the color ebbing from his face again,
and he looked at me as I&#8217;d never seen him look at me
before. We&#8217;d both been mauled by the paw of Destiny,
and we were both nursing ragged nerves and
oversensitized spirits, facing each other as irritable
as teased rattlers, ready to thump rocks with our head.
More than once I&#8217;d heard Dinky-Dunk proclaim that
the right sort of people never bickered and quarreled.
And I remembered Theobald Gustav&#8217;s pet aphorism to
the effect that <i>Hassen machts nichts</i>. But life had its
limits. And I wasn&#8217;t one of those pink-eared shivery
little white mice who could be intimidated into tears by
a frown of disapproval from my imperial mate. And
married life, after all, is only a sort of <i>guerre d&#8217;usure</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think you&#8217;re doing the right thing?&#8221; I
demanded of my husband, not without derision, confronting
him with a challenge on my face and a
bawling Pee-Wee on my hip.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk sniffed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That child seems to have its mother&#8217;s disposition,&#8221;
he murmured, ignoring my question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The prospects of its acquiring anything better
from its father seem rather remote,&#8221; I retorted, striking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
blindly. For that over-deft adding of insult to
injury had awakened every last one of my seven
sleeping devils. It was an evidence of cruelty, cold
and calculated cruelty. And by this time little waves
of liquid fire were running through my tingling body.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I can&#8217;t be of much service to this family,&#8221;
announced Dinky-Dunk, with his maddening note
of mockery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see how you can be a retriever for a
flabby-minded idler and the head of this household at
one and the same time,&#8221; I said out of the seething
crater-fogs of my indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never impressed me as being flabby,&#8221; he
ventured, with a quietness which only a person who
knew him would or could recognize as dangerous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t share your admiration for her,&#8221; I
retorted, letting the tide of vitriol carry me along in
its sweep.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s face hardened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what do you intend doing about it?&#8221; he
demanded.
</p>
<p>That was a poser, all right. That was a poser
which, I suppose, many a woman at some time in her
life has been called on to face. What did I intend
doing about it? I didn&#8217;t care much. But I at least
intended to save the bruised and broken hulk of my
pride from utter annihilation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I intend,&#8221; I cried out with a quaver in my voice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
&#8220;since you&#8217;re not able to fill the bill, to be head of
this household myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like an ultimatum,&#8221; said Dinky-Dunk
very slowly, his face the sickly color of a meerschaum-pipe
bowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take it any way you want to,&#8221; I passionately
proclaimed, compelled to raise my voice to the
end that it might surmount Pee-Wee&#8217;s swelling cries.
&#8220;And while you&#8217;re being lackey for Lady Alicia Newland
I&#8217;ll run this ranch. I&#8217;ll run it in my own way,
and I&#8217;ll run it without hanging on to a woman&#8217;s skirt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk stared at me as though he were looking
at me through a leper-squint. But he had been
brutal, was being brutal. And it was a case of fighting
fire with fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re welcome to the job,&#8221; I heard him
proclaiming out of his blind white heat of rage.
&#8220;After <i>that</i>, I&#8217;m through!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be much of a loss,&#8221; I shot back at him,
feeling that he&#8217;d soured a bright and sunny life into
eternal blight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that,&#8221; he said with his jaw squared
and his head down. I saw him push his chair aside
and wheel about and stride away from the Yorkshire
pudding with the caved-in roof, and the roast-beef
that was as cold as my own heart, and the indignantly
protesting Pee-Wee who in some vague way
kept reminding me that I wasn&#8217;t quite as free-handed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
as I had been so airily imagining myself. For I
mistily remembered that the Twins, before the day
was over, were going to find it a very flatulent world.
But I wasn&#8217;t crushed. For there are times when even
wives and worms will turn. And this was one of them.

<h2><i>Thursday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s a busy three days I&#8217;ve been having, and if I&#8217;m
a bit tuckered out in body I&#8217;m still invincible in spirit.
For I&#8217;ve already triumphed over a tangle or two and
now I&#8217;m going to see this thing through. I&#8217;m going
to see Alabama Ranch make good.
</p>
<p>I teamed in to Buckhorn, with Dinkie and the
Twins and Ikkie bedded down in the wagon-box on
fresh wheat-straw, and had a talk with Syd Woodward,
the dealer there. It took me just about ten
minutes to get down to hard-pan with him, once he
was convinced that I meant business. He&#8217;s going to
take over my one heavy team, Tumble-Weed and
Cloud-Maker, though it still gives my heart a wrench
to think of parting with those faithful animals. I&#8217;m
also going to sell off fifteen or eighteen of the heaviest
steers and turn back the tin Lizzie, which can be done
without for a few months at least.
</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, I&#8217;m going to have an 8-16
tractor that&#8217;ll turn over an acre of land in little more
than an hour&#8217;s time, and turn it over a trifle better
than the hired hand&#8217;s usual &#8220;cut and cover&#8221; method,
and at a cost of less than fifty cents an acre. Later
on, I can use my tractor for hauling, or turn it to
practically any other form of farm-power there may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
be a call for. I&#8217;m also getting a special grade of seed-wheat.
There was a time when I thought that wheat
was just merely wheat. It rather opened my eyes
to be told that in one season the Shippers&#8217; Clearance
Association definitely specified and duly handled
exactly four hundred and twenty-eight grades of this
particular grain. Even straight Northern wheat,
without the taint of weed-seed, may be classified in
any of the different numbers up to six, and also
assorted into &#8220;tough,&#8221; &#8220;wet,&#8221; &#8220;damp,&#8221; &#8220;musty,&#8221;
&#8220;binburnt&#8221; and half a dozen other grades and conditions,
according to the season. But since I&#8217;m to be a
wheat-grower, it&#8217;s my duty to find out all I can about
the subject.
</p>
<p>I am also the possessor of three barrels of gasoline,
and a new disk-drill, together with the needed
repairs for the old drill which worked so badly last
season. I&#8217;ve got Whinstane Sandy patching up the
heavy sets of harness, and at daybreak to-morrow
I&#8217;m going to have him out on the land, and also
Francois, who has promised to stay with us another
two weeks. It may be that I&#8217;ll put Ikkie in overalls
and get her out there too, for there&#8217;s not a day, not
an hour, to be lost. I want my crop in. I want my
seed planted, and the sooner the better.
</p>
<p>Whinstane Sandy, on account of his lame foot,
can&#8217;t follow a plow. But there&#8217;s no reason he
shouldn&#8217;t run a tractor. If it wasn&#8217;t for my bairns,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
of course, I&#8217;d take that tractor in hand myself. But
my two little hostages to fortune cut off that chance.
I&#8217;ve decided, however, to have Whinnie build a
canopy-top over the old buckboard, and fit two strong
frames, just behind the dashboard, that will hold a
couple of willow-baskets, end to end. Then I can
nest Poppsy and Pee-Wee in these two baskets, right
under my nose, with little Dinkie beside me in the seat,
and drive from one end of the ranch to the other and
see that the work is being done, and done right. The
Lord knows how I&#8217;ll get back to the shack in time to
rustle the grub&mdash;but we&#8217;ll manage, in some way.
</p>
<p>The Twins have been doing better, the last week or
two. And I rather dread the idea of weaning them.
If I had somebody to look after them I could, I suppose,
get a breast-pump and leave their mid-morning
and mid-afternoon luncheons in cold-storage for them,
and so ride my tractor without interruption. I remember
a New York woman who did that, left the drawn
milk of her breast on ice, so that she might gad and
shop for a half-day at a time. But the more I think
it over the more unnatural and inhuman it seems.
Yet to hunt for help, in this busy land, is like searching
for a needle in a hay-stack. Already, in the clear
morning air, one can hear the stutter and skip and
cough of the tractors along the opalescent sky-line,
accosting the morning sun with their rattle and tattle
of harvests to be. And I intend to be in on the game.

<h2><i>Sunday the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;m too busy to puddle in spilt milk or worry over
things that are past. I can&#8217;t even take time to
rhapsodize over the kitchen-cabinet to which Whinnie
put the finishing touches to-day at noon, though I
know it will save me many a step. Poor old Whinnie,
I&#8217;m afraid, is more a putterer than a plowman. He&#8217;s
had a good deal of trouble with the tractor, and his
lame foot seems to bother him, on account of the long
hours, but he proclaims he&#8217;ll see me through.
</p>
<p>Tractor-plowing, I&#8217;m beginning to discover, isn&#8217;t
the simple operation it sounds, for your land, in the
first place, has to be staked off and marked with
guidons, since you must know your measurements and
have your headlands uniform and your furrows
straight or there&#8217;ll be a woeful mix-up before you
come to the end of your job. The great trouble is
that a tractor can&#8217;t turn in its own length, as a team
of horses can. Hence this deploying space must be
wasted, or plowed later with horses, and your headlands
themselves must be wide enough for the turning
radius of your tractor. Some of the ranchers out
here, I understand, even do their tractor-plowing in
the form of a series of elongated figure-eights, beginning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
at one corner of their tract, claiming this reduces
the time spent with plows out of the ground. But
that looked too complex for me to tackle.
</p>
<p>Then, too, machinery has one thing in common with
man: they occasionally get out of kilter at the very
time you expect most from them. So this morning
I had to bend, if I did not actually break, the Sabbath
by working on my tractor-engine. I put on Ikkie&#8217;s
overalls&mdash;for I <i>have</i> succeeded in coercing Ikkie into
a jumper and the riding-seat of the old gang-plow&mdash;and
went out and studied that tractor. I was determined
to understand just what was giving the trouble.
</p>
<p>It was two hours before I located the same, which
was caused by the timer. But I&#8217;ve conquered the doggoned
thing, and got her to spark right, and I went
a couple of rounds, Sunday and all, just to make
sure she was in working order. And neither my
actions nor my language, I know, are those of a perfect
lady. But any one who&#8217;d lamped me in that
get-up, covered with oil and dust and dirt, would
know that never again could I be a perfect lady. I&#8217;m
a wiper, a greaser, a clodhopper, and, according to
the sullen and brooding-eyed Ikkie, a bit of a slave-driver.
And the odd part of it all is that I&#8217;m wringing
a perverse sort of enjoyment out of the excitement
and the novelty of the thing. I&#8217;m being
something more than a mere mollusk. I&#8217;m making my
power felt, and producing results. And self-expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
I find, is the breath of life to my soul. But
I&#8217;ve scarcely time to do my hair, and my complexion
is gone, and I&#8217;ve got cracks in my cheek-skin. I&#8217;m
getting old and ugly, and no human being will ever
again love me. Even my own babies gape at me kind
of round-eyed when I take them in my arms.
</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m wrong there, and I know I&#8217;m wrong. My
little Dinkie will always love me. I know that by the
way his little brown arms cling about my wind-roughened
neck, by the way he burrows in against my
breast and hangs on to me and hollers for his Mummsy
when she&#8217;s out of sight. He&#8217;s not a model youngster,
I know. I&#8217;m afraid I love him too much to demand
perfection from him. It&#8217;s the hard and selfish women,
after all, who make the ideal mothers&mdash;at least from
the standpoint of the disciplinarian. For the selfish
woman refuses to be blinded by love, just as she
refuses to be imposed upon and declines to be troubled
by the thought of inflicting pain on those perverse
little toddlers who grow so slowly into the knowledge
of what is right and wrong. It hurts me like Sam-Hill,
sometimes, to have to hurt my little man-child.
When the inevitable and slow-accumulating spanking
<i>does</i> come, I try to be cool-headed and strictly just
about it&mdash;for one look out of a child&#8217;s eyes has the
trick of bringing you suddenly to the judgment-bar.
Dinkie, young as he is, can already appraise and
arraign me and flash back his recognition of injustice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
More than once he&#8217;s made me think of those lines of

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my seed in, glory be! The deed is done;
the mad scramble is over. And Mother Earth, as
tired as a child of being mauled, lies sleeping in
the sun.
</p>
<p>If, as some one has said, to plow is to pray, we&#8217;ve
been doing a heap of mouth-worship on Alabama
Ranch this last few weeks. But the final acre has
been turned over, the final long sea of furrows disked
and plank-dragged and seeded down, and after the
heavy rains of Thursday night there&#8217;s just the faintest
tinge of green, here and there, along my billiard-table
of a granary-to-be.
</p>
<p>But the mud is back, and to save my kitchen floor,
last night, I trimmed down a worn-out broom, cut off
most of the handle, and fastened it upside down in a
hole I&#8217;d bored at one end of the lower door-step.
</p>
<p>All this talk of mine about wheat sounds as though
I were what they call out here a Soil Robber, or a
Land Miner, a get-rich-quick squatter who doesn&#8217;t
bother about mixed farming or the rotation of crops,
with no true love for the land which he impoverishes
and leaves behind him when he&#8217;s made his pile. I
want to make my pile, it&#8217;s true, but we&#8217;ll soon have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
other things to think about. There&#8217;s my home garden
to be made ready, and the cattle and pigs to be looked
after, and a run to be built for my chickens. The
latter, for all their neglect, have been laying like mad
and I&#8217;ve three full crates of eggs in the cellar, all
dipped in water-glass and ready for barter at Buckhorn.
If the output keeps up I&#8217;ll store away five or
six crates of the treated eggs for Christmas-season
sale, for in midwinter they easily bring eighty cents
a dozen.
</p>
<p>And speaking of barter reminds me that both
Dinkie and the Twins are growing out of their duds,
and heaven knows when I&#8217;ll find time to make more
for them. They&#8217;ll probably have to promenade around
like Ikkie&#8217;s ancestors. I&#8217;ve even run out of safety-pins.
And since the enduring necessity for the
safety-pin is evidenced by the fact that it&#8217;s even
found on the baby-mummies of ancient Egypt, and
must be a good four thousand years old, I&#8217;ve had
Whinnie supply me with some home-made ones, manufactured
out of hair-pins.... My little Dinkie,
I notice, is going to love animals. He seems especially
fond of horses, and is fearless when beside them, or on
them, or even under them&mdash;for he walked calmly in
under the belly of Jail-Bird, who could have brained
him with one pound of his wicked big hoof. But the
beast seemed to know that it was a friend in that
forbidden quarter, and never so much as moved until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Dinkie had been rescued. It won&#8217;t be long now before
Dinkie has a pinto of his own and will go bobbing
off across the prairie-floor, I suppose, like a monkey
on a circus-horse. Even now he likes nothing better
than coming with his mother while she gathers her
&#8220;clutch&#8221; of eggs. He can scramble into a manger&mdash;where
my unruly hens persist in making an occasional
nest&mdash;like a marmoset. The delight on his
face at the discovery of even two or three &#8220;cackle-berries,&#8221;
as Whinnie calls them, is worth the occasional
breakage and yolk-stained rompers. For I share in
that delight myself, since egg-gathering always gives
me the feeling that I&#8217;m partaking of the bounty of
Nature, that I&#8217;m getting something for next-to-nothing.
It&#8217;s the same impulse, really, which drives
city women to the bargain-counter and the auction-room,
the sublimated passion to adorn the home teepee-pole
with the fruits of their cunning!

<h2><i>Tuesday the Twenty-fifth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Yesterday I teamed in to Buckhorn, for supplies.
And as I drove down the main street of that squalid
little western town I must have looked like something
the crows had been roosting on. But just as I was
swinging out of Syd Woodward&#8217;s store-yard I caught
sight of Lady Allie in her big new car, drawn up in
front of the modestly denominated &#8220;New York
Emporium.&#8221; What made me stare, however, was the
unexpected vision of Duncan Argyll McKail, emerging
from the aforesaid &#8220;Emporium&#8221; laden down with
parcels. These he carried out to the car and was
dutifully stowing away somewhere down in the back
seat, when he happened to look up and catch sight of
me as I swung by in my wagon-box. He turned a
sort of dull brick-red, and pretended to be having a
lot of trouble with getting those parcels where they
ought to be. But he looked exactly like a groom.
And he knew it. And he knew that I knew he knew
it. And if he was miserable, which I hope he was,
I&#8217;m pretty sure he wasn&#8217;t one-half so miserable as I
was&mdash;and as I am. &#8220;<i>Damn that woman!</i>&#8221; I caught
myself saying, out loud, after staring at my mottled
old map in my dressing-table mirror.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching the sunset to-night, for a long
time, and thinking about things. It was one of those
quiet and beautiful prairie sunsets which now and
then flood you with wonder, in spite of yourself, and
give you an achey little feeling in the heart. It was
a riot of orange and Roman gold fading out into pale
green, with misty opal and pearl-dust along the
nearer sky-line, then a big star or two, and then
silence, the silence of utter peace and beauty. But it
didn&#8217;t bring peace to my soul. I could remember
watching just such a sunset with my lord and master
beside me, and turning to say: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you sometimes
feel, Lover, that you were simply made for joy and
rapture in moments like this? Don&#8217;t you feel as
though your body were a harp that could throb and
sing with the happiness of life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And I remembered the way my Dunkie had lifted
up my chin and kissed me.
</p>
<p>But that seemed a long, long time ago. And I
wasn&#8217;t in tune with the Infinite. And I felt lonely
and old and neglected, with callouses on my hands
and the cords showing in my neck, and my nerves not
exactly what they ought to be. For Sunday, which
is reckoned as a day of rest, had been a long and busy
day for me. Dinkie had been obstreperous and had
eaten most of the paint off his Noah&#8217;s Ark, and had
later burnt his fingers pulling my unbaked loaf-cake
out of the oven, after eventually tiring of breaking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the teeth out of my comb, one by one. Poppsy and
Pee-Wee had been peevish and disdainful of each
other&#8217;s society, and Iroquois Annie had gruntingly
intimated that she was about fed up on trekking the
floor with wailing infants. But I&#8217;d had my week&#8217;s
mending to do, and what was left of the ironing to
get through and Whinnie&#8217;s work-pants to veneer with
a generous new patch, and thirteen missing buttons
to restore to the kiddies&#8217; different garments. My
back ached, my finger-bones were tired, and there was
a jumpy little nerve in my left temple going for all
the world like a telegraph-key. And then I gave up.
</p>
<p>I sat down and stared at that neatly folded pile
of baby-clothes two feet high, a layer-cake of whites
and faded blues and pinks. I stared at it, and began
to gulp tragically, wallowing in a wave of self-pity.
I felt so sorry for myself that I let my flat-iron burn
a hole clean through the ironing-sheet, without even
smelling it. That, I told myself, was all that life
could be to me, just a round of washing and ironing
and meal-getting and mending, fetch and carry, work
and worry, from sun-up until sun-down, and many a
time until midnight.
</p>
<p>And what, I demanded of the frying-pan on its nail
above the stove-shelf, was I getting out of it? What
was it leading to? And what would it eventually
bring me? It would eventually bring me crabbed and
crow-footed old age, and fallen arches and a slabsided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
figure that a range-pinto would shy at. It
would bring me empty year after year out here on
the edge of Nowhere. It would bring me drab and
spiritless drudgery, and faded eyes, and the heart
under my ribs slowly but surely growing as dead as
a door-nail, and the joy of living just as slowly but
surely going out of my life, the same as the royal
blue had faded out of Dinkie&#8217;s little denim jumpers.
</p>
<p>At that very moment, I remembered, there were
women listening to symphony music in Carnegie Hall,
and women sitting in willow-rockers at Long Beach
contentedly listening to the sea-waves. There were
women driving through Central Park, soft and lovely
with early spring, or motoring up to the Clairemont
for supper and watching the searchlights from the
war-ships along the Hudson, and listening to the
music on the roof-gardens and dancing their feet off
at that green-topped heaven of youth which overlooks
the Plaza where Sherman&#8217;s bronze horse forever
treads its spray of pine. There were happy-go-lucky
girls crowding the soda-fountains and regaling
themselves on fizzy water and fruit sirups, and dropping
in at first nights or motoring out for sea-food
dinners along lamp-pearled and moonlit boulevards
of smooth asphalt. And here I was planted half-way
up to the North Pole, with coyotes for company, with
a husband who didn&#8217;t love me, and not a jar of decent
face-cream within fifteen miles of the shack! I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
lost there in a sea of flat desolation, without companionable
neighbors, without an idea, without a chance
for any exchange of thought. I had no time for
reading, and what was even worse, I had no desire for
reading, but plodded on, like the stunned ox, kindred
to the range animals and sister to the cow.
</p>
<p>Then, as I sat luxuriating before my crowded
banquet-table of misery, as I sat mopping my nose&mdash;which
was getting most unmistakably rough with
prairie-winds and alkali-water&mdash;and thinking what a
fine mess I&#8217;d made of a promising young life, I fancied
I heard an altogether too familiar C-sharp cry. So I
got wearily up and went tiptoeing in to see if either
Poppsy or Pee-Wee were awake.
</p>
<p>But they were there, safe and sound and fast asleep,
curled up like two plump little kittens, with their long
lashes on their cheeks of peach-blow pink and their
dewy little lips slightly parted and four little dimples
in the back of each of the four little hands. And as
I stood looking down at them, with a shake still under
my breastbone, I couldn&#8217;t keep from saying: &#8220;God
bless your sleepy old bones!&#8221; Something melted and
fell from the dripping eaves of my heart, and I felt
that it was a sacred and God-given and joyous life,
this life of being a mother, and any old maid who
wants to pirouette around the Plaza roof with a
lounge-lizard breathing winy breaths into her false
hair was welcome to her choice. I was at least in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
battle of life&mdash;and life is a battle which scars you
more when you try to keep out of it than when you
wade into it. I was a mother and a home-maker and
the hope and buttress of the future. And all I wanted
was a good night&#8217;s sleep and some candid friend to
tell me not to be a feather-headed idiot, but a sensible
woman with a sensible perspective on things!

<p>It has turned quite cold again, with frosts sharp
enough at night to freeze a half-inch of ice on the
tub of soft-water I&#8217;ve been so carefully saving for
future shampoos. It&#8217;s just as well I didn&#8217;t try to
rush the season by getting too much of my truck-garden
planted. We&#8217;re glad of a good fire in the
shack-stove after sun-down. I&#8217;ve rented thirty acres
from the Land Association that owns the half-section
next to mine and am going to get them into oats. If
they don&#8217;t ripen up before the autumn frosts come
and blight them, I can still use the stuff for green
feed. And I&#8217;ve bargained for the hay-rights from
the upper end of the section, but heaven only knows
how I&#8217;ll ever get it cut and stacked.
</p>
<p>Whinnie had to kill a calf yesterday, for we&#8217;d run
out of meat. As we&#8217;re in a district that&#8217;s too sparsely
settled for a Beef Ring, we have to depend on ourselves
for our roasts. But whatever happens, I believe
in feeding my workers. I wonder, by the way, how
the fair Lady Allie is getting along with her <i>cuisine</i>.
Is she giving Dinky-Dunk a Beautiful Thought for
breakfast, instead of a generous plate of ham and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
eggs? If she is, I imagine she&#8217;s going to blight
Romance in the bud.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just had a circular letter from the Women
Grain Growers&#8217; Association explaining their fight for
community medical service and a system of itinerant
rural nurses. They&#8217;re organized, and they&#8217;re in
earnest, and I&#8217;m with them to the last ditch. They&#8217;re
fighting for the things that this raw new country is
most in need of. It will take us some time to catch
up with the East. But the westerner&#8217;s a scrambler,
once he&#8217;s started.
</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t get away from the fact, since I know them
both, that there&#8217;s a big gulf between the East and
the West. It shouldn&#8217;t be there, of course, but that
doesn&#8217;t seem to affect the issue. It&#8217;s the opposition
of the New to the Old, of the Want-To-Bes to the
Always-Has-Beens, of the young and unruly to the
settled and sedate. We seem to want freedom, and
they seem to prefer order. We want movement, and
they want repose. We look more feverishly to the
future, and they dwell more fondly on the past. They
call us rough, and we try to get even by terming
them <i>effete</i>. They accentuate form, and we remain
satisfied with performance. We&#8217;re jealous of what
they have and they&#8217;re jealous of what we intend to
be. We&#8217;re even secretly envious of certain things
peculiarly theirs which we openly deride. We&#8217;re
jealous, at heart, of their leisure and their air of permanence,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
of their accomplishments and arts and
books and music, of their buildings and parks and
towns with the mellowing tone of time over them. And
as soon as we make money enough, I notice, we slip
into their neighborhood for a gulp or two at their
fountains of culture. Some day, naturally, we&#8217;ll be
more alike, and have more in common. The stronger
colors will fade out of the newer fabric and we&#8217;ll
merge into a more inoffensive monotone of respectability.
Our Navajo-blanket audacities will tone
down to wall-tapestry sedateness&mdash;but not too, too
soon, I pray the gods!
</p>
<p>Speaking of Navajo reminds me of Redskins,
and Redskins take my thoughts straight back to
Iroquois Annie, who day by day becomes sullener and
stupider and more impossible. I can see positive
dislike for my Dinkie in her eyes, and I&#8217;m at present
applying zinc ointment to Pee-Wee&#8217;s chafed and
scalded little body because of her neglect. I&#8217;ll ring-welt
and quarter that breed yet, mark my words! As
it is, there&#8217;s a constant cloud of worry over my heart
when I&#8217;m away from the shack and my bairns are
left behind. This same Ikkie, apparently, tried to
scald poor old Bobs the other day, but Bobs dodged
most of that steaming potato-water and decided to
even up the ledger of ill-usage by giving her a well-placed
nip on the hip. Ikkie now sits down with
difficulty, and Bobs shows the white of his eye when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
she comes near him, which isn&#8217;t more often than
Ikkie can help&mdash;And of such, in these troublous
Ides of March, and April and May, is the kingdom
of Chaddie McKail!

<h2><i>Tuesday the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I may as well begin at the beginning, I suppose,
so as to get the whole thing straight. And it started
with Whinstane Sandy, who broke the wheel off the
spring-wagon and the third commandment at one and
the same time. So I harnessed Slip-Along up to the
buckboard, and put the Twins in their two little
crow&#8217;s-nests and started out to help get my load out
of that bogged trail, leaving Dinkie behind with Iroquois
Annie.
</p>
<p>There was a chill in the air and I was glad of my
old coonskin coat. It was almost two hours before
Whinnie and I got the spring-wagon out of its mud-bath,
and the load on again, and a willow fence-post
lashed under the drooping axle-end to sustain it on
its journey back to Alabama Ranch. The sun was
low, by this time, so I couldn&#8217;t wait for Whinnie and
the team, but drove on ahead with the Twins.
</p>
<p>I was glad to see the smoke going up from my
lonely little shack-chimney, for I was mud-splashed
and tired and hungry, and the thought of fire and
home and supper gave me a comfy feeling just under
the tip of the left ventricle. I suppose it was the
long evening shadows and the chill of the air that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
made the shack look so unutterably lonely as I drove
up to it. Or perhaps it was because I stared in vain
for some sign of life. At any rate, I didn&#8217;t stop to
unhitch Slip-Along, but gathered up my Twins and
made for the door, and nearly stumbled on my nose
over the broom-end boot-wiper which hadn&#8217;t proved
such a boon as I&#8217;d expected.
</p>
<p>I found Iroquois Annie in front of my home-made
dressing-table mirror, with my last year&#8217;s summer
hat on her head and a look of placid admiration on
her face. The shack seemed very quiet. It seemed
so disturbingly quiet that I even forgot about the hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dinkie?&#8221; I demanded, as I deposited the
Twins in their swing-box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He play somew&#8217;ere roun&#8217;,&#8221; announced Ikkie,
secreting the purloined head-gear and circling away
from the forbidden dressing-table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where?&#8221; I asked, with exceptional sharpness,
for my eye had already traversed the most of that
shack and had encountered no sign of him.
</p>
<p>That sloe-eyed breed didn&#8217;t know just where, and
apparently didn&#8217;t care. He was playing somewhere
outside, with three or four old wooden decoy-ducks.
That was all she seemed to know. But I didn&#8217;t stop
to question her. I ran to the door and looked out.
Then my heart began going down like an elevator,
for I could see nothing of the child. So I made the
rounds of the shack again, calling &#8220;Dinkie!&#8221; as I went.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Then I looked through the bunk-house, and even
tried the cellar. Then I went to the rainwater tub,
with my heart up in my throat. He wasn&#8217;t there, of
course. So I made a flying circle of the out-buildings.
But still I got no trace of him.
</p>
<p>I was panting when I got back to the shack, where
Iroquois Annie was fussing stolidly over the stove-fire.
I caught her by the snake-like braid of her hair,
though I didn&#8217;t know I was doing it, at the moment,
and swung her about so that my face confronted hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my boy?&#8221; I demanded in a sort of shout
of mingled terror and rage and dread. &#8220;Where is he,
you empty-eyed idiot? <i>Where is he?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that half-breed, of course, couldn&#8217;t tell me.
And a wave of sick fear swept over me. My Dinkie
was not there. He was nowhere to be found. He was
lost&mdash;lost on the prairie. And I was shouting all
this at Ikkie, without being quite conscious of what
I was doing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And remember,&#8221; I hissed out at her, in a voice
that didn&#8217;t sound like my own as I swung her about
by her suddenly parting waist, &#8220;if anything has
happened to that child, <i>I&#8217;ll kill you!</i> Do you understand,
I&#8217;ll kill you as surely as you&#8217;re standing
in those shoes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I went over the shack, room by room, for still the
third time. Then I went over the bunk-house and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the other buildings, and every corner of the truck-garden,
calling as I went.
</p>
<p>But still there was no answer to my calls. And I
had to face the steel-cold knowledge that my child
was lost. That little toddler, scarcely more than a
baby, had wandered away on the open prairie.
</p>
<p>For one moment of warming relief I thought of
Bobs. I remembered what a dog is sometimes able
to do in such predicaments. But I also remembered
that Bobs was still out on the trail with Whinnie.
So I circled off on the undulating floor of the prairie,
calling &#8220;Dinkie&#8221; every minute or two and staring into
the distance until my eyes ached, hoping to see some
moving dot in the midst of all that silence and stillness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy is lost,&#8221; I kept saying to myself, in
sobbing little whimpers, with my heart getting more
and more like a ball of lead. And there could only
be an hour or two of daylight left. If he wasn&#8217;t
found before night came on&mdash;I shut the thought out
of my heart, and started back for the shack, in a
white heat of desperation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to live,&#8221; I said to the now craven and
shrinking Ikkie, &#8220;you get in that buckboard and make
for Casa Grande. Drive there as fast as you can.
Tell my husband that our boy, that my boy, is lost
on the prairie. Tell him to get help, and come, come
quick. And stop at the Teetzel ranch on your way.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
Tell them to send men on horses, and lanterns! But
move, woman, move!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ikkie went, with Slip-Along making the buckboard
skid on the uneven trail as though he were playing
a game of crack-the-whip with that frightened Indian.
And I just as promptly took up my search again,
forgetting about the Twins, forgetting about being
tired, forgetting everything.
</p>
<p>Half-way between the fenced-in hay-stacks and the
corral-gate I found a battered decoy-duck with a
string tied to its neck. It was one of a set that
Francois and Whinstane Sandy had whittled out over
a year ago. It was at least a clue. Dinkie must
have dropped it there.
</p>
<p>It sent me scuttling back among the hay-stacks,
going over the ground there, foot by foot and calling
as I went, until my voice had an eerie sound in the
cold air that took on more and more of a razor-edge
as the sun and the last of its warmth went over the
rim of the world. It seemed an empty world, a plain
of ugly desolation, unfriendly and pitiless in its vastness.
Even the soft green of the wheatlands took
on a look like verdigris, as though it were something
malignant and poisonous. And farther out there were
muskegs, and beyond the three-wire fence, which
would stand no bar to a wandering child, there were
range-cattle, half-wild cattle that resented the
approach of anything but a man on horseback. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
somewhere in those darkening regions of peril my
Dinky-Dink was lost.
</p>
<p>I took up the search again, with the barometer of
hope falling lower and lower. But I told myself that
I must be systematic, that I must not keep covering
the same ground, that I must make the most of what
was left of the daylight. So I blocked out imaginary
squares and kept running and calling until I was out
of breath, then resting with my hand against my
heart, and running on again. But I could find no
trace of him.
</p>
<p>He was such a little tot, I kept telling myself. He
was not warmly dressed, and night was coming on.
It would be a cold night, with several degrees of frost.
He would be alone, on that wide and empty prairie,
with terror in his heart, chilled to the bone, wailing
for his mother, wailing until he was able to wail no
more. Already the light was going, I realized with
mounting waves of desperation, and no child, dressed
as Dinkie was dressed, could live through the night.
Even the coyotes would realize his helplessness and
come and pick his bones clean.
</p>
<p>I kept thinking of Bobs, more than of anything
else, and wondering why Whinnie was so slow in getting
back with his broken wagon, and worrying over
when the men would come. I told myself to be calm,
to be brave, and the next moment was busy picturing
a little dead body with a tear-washed face. But I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
went on, calling as I went. Then suddenly I thought
of praying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair, to take that little mite
away from me,&#8221; I kept saying aloud. &#8220;O God, be
good to me in this, be merciful, and lead me to him!
Bring him back before it is too late! Bring him back,
and do with me what You wish, but have pity on that
poor little toddler! What You want of me, I will do,
but don&#8217;t, O God, don&#8217;t take my boy away from me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I made promises to God, foolish, desperate, infantile
promises; trying to placate Him in His might
with my resolutions for better things, trying to strike
bargains, at the last moment, with the Master of Life
and Death&mdash;even protesting that I&#8217;d forgive Dinky-Dunk
for anything and everything he might have
done, and that it was the Evil One speaking through
my lips when I said I&#8217;d surely kill Iroquois Annie.
</p>
<p>Then I heard the signal-shots of a gun, and turned
back toward the shack, which looked small and squat
on the floor of the paling prairie. I couldn&#8217;t run, for
running was beyond me now. I heard Bobs barking,
and the Twins crying, and I saw Whinnie. I thought
for one fond and foolish moment, as I hurried toward
the house, that they&#8217;d found my Dinkie. But it was
a false hope. Whinnie had been frightened at the
empty shack and the wailing babies, and had thought
something might have happened to me. So he had
taken my duck-gun and fired those signal-shots.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>He leaned against the muddy wagon-wheel and said
&#8220;Guid God! Guid God!&#8221; over and over again, when
I told him Dinkie was lost. Then he flung down the
gun and drew his twisted old body up, peering
through the twilight at my face.
</p>
<p>I suppose it frightened him a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna fear, lassie, dinna fear,&#8221; he said. He said
it in such a deep and placid voice that it carried consolation
to my spirit, and brought a shadow of conviction
trailing along behind it. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find him. I
say it before the livin&#8217; God, <i>we&#8217;ll find him</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that little candle of hope went out in the cold
air, for I could see that night was coming closer, cold
and dark and silent. I forgot about Whinnie, and
didn&#8217;t even notice which direction he took when he
strode off on his lame foot. But I called Bobs to me,
and tried to quiet his whimpering, and talked to him,
and told him Dinkie was lost, the little Dinkie we all
loved, and implored him to go and find my boy for me.
</p>
<p>But the poor dumb creature didn&#8217;t seem to understand
me, for he cringed and trembled and showed a
tendency to creep off to the stable and hide there, as
though the weight of this great evil which had befallen
his house lay on him and him alone. And I
was trying to coax the whimpering Bobs back to the
shack-steps when Dinky-Dunk himself came galloping
up through the uncertain light, with Lady Alicia a
few hundred yards behind him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found him?&#8221; my husband asked, quick
and curt. But there was a pale greenish-yellow tint
to his face that made me think of Rocquefort cheese.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I told him. I tried to speak calmly, determined
not to break down and make a scene there before
Lady Alicia, who&#8217;d reined up, stock-still, and sat staring
in front of her, without a spoken word.
</p>
<p>I could see Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s mouth harden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any clue&mdash;any hint?&#8221; he asked, and I
could catch the quaver in his voice as he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; I told him, remembering that we
were losing time. &#8220;He simply wandered off, when
that Indian girl wasn&#8217;t looking. He didn&#8217;t even have
a cap or a coat on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I heard Lady Alicia, who had slipped down out of
the saddle, make a little sound as I said this. It was
half a gasp and half a groan of protest. For one
brief moment Dinky-Dunk stared at her, almost
accusingly, I thought. Then he swung his horse
savagely about, and called out over our heads. Other
horsemen, I found, had come loping up in the ghostly
twilight where we stood. I could see the breath from
their mounts&#8217; nostrils, white in the frosty air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Teetzel, and you, O&#8217;Malley,&#8221; called my husband,
in an oddly authoritative and barking voice,
&#8220;and you on the roan there, swing twenty paces out
from one another and circle the shack. Then widen
the circle, each turn. There&#8217;s no use calling, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
boy&#8217;ll be down. He&#8217;ll be done out. But don&#8217;t speak
until you see something. And for the love of God,
watch close. He&#8217;s not three yet, remember. He
couldn&#8217;t have got far away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I should have found something reassuring in those
quick and purposeful words of command, but they
only served to bring the horror of the situation closer
home to me. They brought before me more graphically
than ever the thought that I&#8217;d been trying to
get out of my head, the picture of a huddled small
body, with a tear-washed face, growing colder and
colder, until the solitary little flame of life went completely
out in the midst of that star-strewn darkness.
Only too willingly, I knew, I would have covered that
chilling body with the warmth of my own, though wild
horses rode over me until the end of time. I tried to
picture life without Dinkie. I tried to imagine my
home without that bright and friendly little face,
without the patter of those restless little feet, without
the sound of those beleaguering little coos of child-love
with which he used to burrow his head into the
hollow of my shoulder.
</p>
<p>It was too much for me. I had to lean against
the wagon-wheel and gulp. It was Lady Alicia,
emerging from the shack, who brought me back to the
world about me. I could just see her as she stood
beside me, for night had fallen by this time, night
nearly as black as the blackness of my own heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; she said almost gruffly. &#8220;Whatever
happens, you&#8217;ve got to have something to drink. I&#8217;ve
got a kettle on, and I&#8217;m going back to make tea, or a
pot of coffee, or whatever I can find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tea?&#8221; I echoed, as the engines of indignation
raced in my shaken body. &#8220;Tea? It sounds pretty,
doesn&#8217;t it, sitting down to a pink tea, when there&#8217;s a
human being dying somewhere out in that darkness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>My bitterness, however, had no visible effect on
Lady Alicia.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps coffee would be better,&#8221; she coolly
amended. &#8220;And those babies of yours are crying
their heads off in there, and I don&#8217;t seem to be able to
do anything to stop them. I rather fancy they&#8217;re in
need of feeding, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was then and then only that I remembered about
my poor neglected Twins. I groped my way in
through the darkness, quite calm again, and sat down
and unbuttoned my waist and nursed Poppsy, and
then took up the indignant and wailing Pee-Wee,
vaguely wondering if the milk in my breast wouldn&#8217;t
prove poison to them and if all my blood hadn&#8217;t
turned to acid.
</p>
<p>I was still nursing Pee-Wee when Bud Teetzel
came into the shack and asked how many lanterns we
had about the place. There was a sullen look on his
face, and his eyes refused to meet mine. So I knew
his search had not succeeded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Then young O&#8217;Malley came in and asked for
matches, and I knew even before he spoke, that he too
had failed. They had all failed.
</p>
<p>I could hear Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s voice outside, a little
hoarse and throaty. I felt very tired, as I put Pee-Wee
back in his cradle. It seemed as though an
invisible hand were squeezing the life out of my body
and making it hard for me to breathe. I could hear
the cows bawling, reminding the world that they had
not yet been milked. I could smell the strong coffee
that Lady Alicia was pouring out into a cup. She
stepped on something as she carried it to me. She
stopped to pick it up&mdash;and it was one of Dinkie&#8217;s
little stub-toed button shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it,&#8221; I commanded, as she made a foolish
effort to get it out of sight. I took it from her and
turned it over in my hand. That was the way, I
remembered, mothers turned over the shoes of the
children they had lost, the children who could never,
never, so long as they worked and waited and listened
in this wide world, come back to them again.
</p>
<p>Then I put down the shoe, for I could hear one of
the men outside say that the upper muskeg ought
to be dragged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try that cup of coffee now,&#8221; suggested Lady
Alicia. I liked her quietness. I admired her calmness,
under the circumstances. And I remembered
that I ought to give some evidence of this by accepting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
the hot drink she had made for me. So I took
the coffee and drank it. The bawling of my milk-cows,
across the cold night air, began to annoy me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My cows haven&#8217;t been milked,&#8221; I complained. It
was foolish, but I couldn&#8217;t help it. Then I reached
out for Dinkie&#8217;s broken-toed shoe, and studied it for
a long time. Lady Alicia crossed to the shack door,
and stood staring out through it....
</p>
<p>She was still standing there when Whinnie came in,
with the stable lantern in his hand, and brushed her
aside. He came to where I was sitting and knelt down
in front of me, on the shack-floor, with his heavy
rough hand on my knee. I could smell the stable-manure
that clung to his shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God has been guid to ye, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he said in a
rapt voice, which was little more than an awed whisper.
But it was more his eyes, with the uncanny light in
them making them shine like a dog&#8217;s, that brought
me to my feet. For I had a sudden feeling that there
was Something just outside the door which he hadn&#8217;t
dared to bring in to me, a little dead body with
pinched face and trailing arms.
</p>
<p>I tried to speak, but I couldn&#8217;t. I merely gulped.
And Whinnie&#8217;s rough hand pushed me back into
my chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna greet,&#8221; he said, with two tears creeping
crookedly down his own seamed and wind-roughened
face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>But I continued to gulp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna greet, for <i>your laddie&#8217;s safe and sound</i>!&#8221;
I heard the rapt voice saying.
</p>
<p>I could hear what he&#8217;d said, quite distinctly, yet
his words seemed without color, without meaning,
without sense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found him?&#8221; called out Lady Alicia
sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, he&#8217;s found,&#8221; said Whinnie, with an exultant
gulp of his own, but without so much as turning to
look at that other woman, who, apparently, was of
small concern to him. His eyes were on me, and he
was very intimately patting my leg, without quite
knowing it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says that the child&#8217;s been found,&#8221; interpreted
Lady Alicia, obviously disturbed by the expression on
my face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just yon, as warm and safe as a bird in a
nest,&#8221; further expounded Whinstane Sandy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded Lady Alicia. But Whinnie
ignored her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Bobs, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; were the blessed words I
heard the old lips saying to me, &#8220;who kept whimper-in&#8217;
and grievin&#8217; about the upper stable door, which
had been swung shut. It was Bobs who led me back
yon, fair against my will. And there I found our
laddie, asleep in the manger of Slip-Along, nested
deep in the hay, as safe and warm as if in his own bed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t speak or move for what must have been a
full minute. I couldn&#8217;t. I felt as though my soul
had been inverted and emptied of all feeling, like a
wine-glass that&#8217;s turned over. For a full minute I
sat looking straight ahead of me. Then I got up, and
went to where I remembered Dinky-Dunk kept his
revolver. I took it up and started to cross to the open
door. But Lady Alicia caught me sharply by the
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she gasped, imagining, I
suppose, that I&#8217;d gone mad and was about to blow my
brains out. She even took the firearm from my hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the men,&#8221; I tried to explain. &#8220;They should
be told. Give them three signal-shots to bring them
in.&#8221; Then I turned to Whinnie. He nodded and
took me by the hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now take me to my boy,&#8221; I said very quietly.
</p>
<p>I was still quite calm, I think. But deep down inside
of me I could feel a faint glow. It wasn&#8217;t altogether
joy, and it wasn&#8217;t altogether relief. It was
something which left me just a little bewildered, a
good deal like a school-girl after her first glass of
champagne at Christmas dinner. It left me oddly
self-immured, miles and miles from the figures so close
to me, remote even from the kindly old man who hobbled
a little and went with a decided list to starboard
as he led me out toward what he always spoke of as
the upper stable.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>

<img src='images/c003.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
He was warm and breathing, and safe and sound
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Yet at the back of my brain, all the while, was some
shadow of doubt, of skepticism, of reiterated self-warning
that it was all too good to be true. It wasn&#8217;t
until I looked over the well-gnawed top rail of Slip-Along&#8217;s
broken manger and saw that blessed boy there,
by the light of Whinnie&#8217;s lantern, saw that blessed
boy of mine half buried in that soft and cushioning
prairie-grass, saw that he was warm and breathing,
and safe and sound, that I fully realized how he had
been saved for me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The laddie&#8217;d been after a clutch of eggs, I&#8217;m
thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; whispered Whinnie to me, pointing to a
yellow stain on his waist, which was clearly caused by
the yolk of a broken egg. And Whinnie stooped
over to take Dinkie up in his arms, but I pushed him
aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll take him,&#8221; I announced.
</p>
<p>He&#8217;d be the hungry boy when he awakened, I remembered
as I gathered him up in my arms. My
knees were a bit shaky, as I carried him back to the
shack, but I did my best to disguise that fact. I
could have carried him, I believe, right on to Buckhorn,
he seemed such a precious burden. And I was
glad of that demand for physical expenditure. It
seemed to bring me down to earth again, to get things
back into perspective. But for the life of me I
couldn&#8217;t find a word to say to Lady Allie as I walked
into my home with Dinky-Dink in my arms. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
stood watching me for a moment or two as I started
to undress him, still heavy with slumber. Then she
seemed to realize that she was, after all, an outsider,
and slipped out through the door. I was glad she
did, for a minute later Dinkie began to whimper and
cry, as any child would with an empty stomach and an
over-draft of sleep. It developed into a good lusty
bawl, which would surely have spoilt the picture to
an outsider. But it did a good turn in keeping me
too busy to pump any more brine on my own part.
</p>
<p>When Dinky-Dunk came in I was feeding little
Dinkie a bowl of hot tapioca well drowned in cream
and sugar. My lord and master took off his hat&mdash;which
struck me as funny&mdash;and stood regarding us
from just inside the door. He stood there by the door
for quite a long while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I better stay here with you to-night?&#8221; he
finally asked, in a voice that didn&#8217;t sound a bit like
his own.
</p>
<p>I looked up at him. But he stood well back from
the range of the lamplight and I found it hard to decipher
his expression. The one feeling I was certain
of was a vague feeling of disappointment. What
caused it, I could not say. But it was there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After what&#8217;s happened,&#8221; I told him as quietly as
I could, &#8220;I think I&#8217;d rather be alone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood for another moment or two, apparently
letting this sink in. It wasn&#8217;t until he&#8217;d turned and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
walked out of the door that I realized the ambiguity
of that retort of mine. I was almost prompted to go
after him. But I checked myself by saying: &#8220;Well,
if the shoe fits, put it on!&#8221; But in my heart of hearts
I didn&#8217;t mean it. I wanted him to come back, I
wanted him to share my happiness with me, to sit and
talk the thing over, to exploit it to the full in a sweet
retrospect of relief, as people seem to want to do after
they&#8217;ve safely passed through great peril.
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until half an hour later, when Dinkie was
sound asleep again and tucked away in his crib, that I
remembered my frantic promises to God to forgive
Dinky-Dunk everything, if He&#8217;d only bring my boy
back to me. And there&#8217;d been other promises, equally
foolish and frantic. I&#8217;ve been thinking them over, in
fact, and I <i>am</i> going to make an effort to keep them.
I&#8217;m so happy that it hurts. And when you&#8217;re happy,
you want other people to be that way, too.

<h2><i>Wednesday the Third</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Humor is the salt of life. The older I grow the
more I realize that truth. And I&#8217;m going to keep
more of it, if I can, in the work-room of my soul.
Last night, when Dinky-Dunk and I were so uppish
with each other, one single clap of humor might have
shaken the solemnity out of the situation and shown
us up for the poseurs we really were. But Pride is
the mother of all contention. If Dinky-Dunk, when
I was so imperially dismissing him from his own home,
had only up and said: &#8220;Look here, Lady-bird, this
is as much my house as it is yours, you feather-headed
little idiot, and I&#8217;ll put a June-bug down your neck
if you don&#8217;t let me stay here!&#8221; If he&#8217;d only said that,
and sat down and been the safety-valve to my emotions
which all husbands ought to be to all wives, the igloo
would have melted about my heart and left me nothing
to do but crawl over to him and tell him that I missed
him more than tongue could tell, and that getting
Dinkie&#8217;s daddy back was almost as good as getting
Dinkie himself back to me.
</p>
<p>But we missed our chance. And I suppose Lady
Allie sat up until all hours of the night, over at Casa
Grande, consoling my Diddums and talking things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
over. It gives me a sort of bruised feeling, for I&#8217;ve
nobody but Whinstane Sandy to unbosom my soul
to....
</p>
<p>Iroquois Annie has flown the coop. She has gone
for good. I must have struck terror deeper into the
heart of that Redskin than I imagined, for rather
than face death and torture at my hands she left
Slip-Along and the buckboard at the Teetzel Ranch
and vamoosed off into the great unknown. I have
done up her valuables in an old sugar-sack, and if
they&#8217;re not sent for in a week&#8217;s time I&#8217;ll make a bonfire
of the truck. Whinnie, by the way, is to help me
with the house-work. He is much better at washing
dishes than I ever thought he could be. And he announces
he can make a fair brand of bannock, if we
run out of bread.

<h2><i>Tuesday the Ninth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a hired man. He dropped like manna,
out of the skies, or, rather, he emerged like a tadpole
out of the mud. But there&#8217;s something odd about
him and I&#8217;ve a floaty idea he&#8217;s a refugee from justice
and that some day one of the Mounties will come riding
up to my shack-door and lead my farm-help away
in handcuffs.
</p>
<p>Whatever he is, I can&#8217;t quite make him out. But I
have my suspicions, and I&#8217;m leaving everything in
abeyance until they&#8217;re confirmed.
</p>
<p>I was on Paddy the other morning, in my old shooting-jacket
and Stetson, going like the wind for the
Dixon Ranch, after hearing they had a Barnado boy
they wanted to unload on anybody who&#8217;d undertake
to keep him under control. The trail was heavy from
the night rain that had swept the prairie like a new
broom, but the sun was shining again and the air was
like champagne. The ozone and the exercise and
Paddy&#8217;s <i>legato</i> stride all tended to key up my spirits,
and I went along humming:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Bake me a bannock,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>And cut me a callop,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I saw Paddy&#8217;s ear prick up like a
rabbit&#8217;s that I noticed the gun-boat on the trail ahead.
At least I thought it was a gun-boat, for a minute or
two, until I cantered closer and saw that it was a huge
gray touring-car half foundered in the prairie-mud.
Beside it sat a long lean man in very muddy clothes
and a rather disreputable-looking hat. He sat with a
ridiculously contented look on his face, smoking a
small briar pipe, and he laughed outright as I circled
his mud-hole and came to a stop opposite the car with
its nose poked deep down in the mire, for all the world
like a rooting shote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Diana,&#8221; he said, quite coolly, as he
removed his battered-looking cap.
</p>
<p>His salutation struck me as impertinent, so I returned
it in the curtest of nods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in trouble?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; he airily replied, still eying me.
&#8220;But my car seems to be, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; I demanded, determined that he
shouldn&#8217;t elbow me out of my matter-of-factness.
</p>
<p>He turned to his automobile and inspected it with an
indifferent eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned this old tub into a steam-engine, racing
her until the water boiled, and she got even with me
by blowing up an intake hose. But I&#8217;m perfectly satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With what?&#8221; I coldly inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With being stuck here,&#8221; he replied; He had
rather a bright gray eye with greenish lights in it, and
he looked rational enough. But there was something
fundamentally wrong with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you feel that way?&#8221; I asked, though
for a moment I&#8217;d been prompted to inquire if they
hadn&#8217;t let him out a little too soon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I wouldn&#8217;t have seen you, who should be
wearing a crescent moon on your brow, if my good
friend Hyacinthe hadn&#8217;t mired herself in this mud-hole,&#8221;
he had the effrontery to tell me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything so remarkably consolatory in
that vision?&#8221; I asked, deciding that I might as well
convince him he wasn&#8217;t confronting an untutored she-coolie
of the prairie. Whereupon he studied me more
pointedly and more impersonally than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than consolatory,&#8221; he said with an accentuating
flourish of the little briar pipe. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite
compensatory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was rather ponderously clever, I suppose; but
I was tired of both verbal quibbling and roadside
gallantry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to get out of that hole?&#8221; I demanded.
For it&#8217;s a law of the prairie-land, of course, never to
side-step a stranger in distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if it means an ending to this interview,&#8221; he
told me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>It was my turn to eye him. But there wasn&#8217;t much
warmth in the inspection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do?&#8221; I calmly inquired,
for prairie life hadn&#8217;t exactly left me a shy and timorous
gazelle in the haunts of that stalker known as
Man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out,&#8221; he just as calmly retorted,
apparently quite unimpressed by my uppity
tone, &#8220;how anything as radiant and lovely as you ever
got landed up here in this heaven of chilblains and
coyotes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hare-brained idiot was actually trying to make
love to me. And I then and there decided to put a
brake on his wheel of eloquence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m still trying to figure out,&#8221; I told him,
&#8220;how what impresses me as rather a third-class type
of man is able to ride around in what looks like a
first-class car! Unless,&#8221; and the thought came to me
out of a clear sky, and when they come that way
they&#8217;re inspirations and are usually true, &#8220;unless you
stole it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned a solemn eye on the dejected-looking
vehicle and studied it from end to end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m that far behind Hyacinthe,&#8221; he indifferently
acknowledged, &#8220;I begin to fathom the secret
of my life failure. So my morning hasn&#8217;t been altogether
wasted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you did steal the car?&#8221; I persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be a secret between us,&#8221; he said, with
a distinctly guilty look about the sky-line, as though
to make sure there were no sheriffs and bloodhounds
on his track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; I demanded, determined
to thrash the thing out, now that it had been
thrust upon me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking to the most charming woman I&#8217;ve encountered
west of the Great Lakes,&#8221; he said with an
ironic and yet a singularly engaging smile. But I
didn&#8217;t intend him to draw a herring across the trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be obliged if you&#8217;d be sincere,&#8221; I told him,
sitting up a little straighter on Paddy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sincere,&#8221; he protested, putting away his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the things you&#8217;re saying are the things the
right sort of person refrains from expressing, even
when he happens to be the victim of their operation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s quite true, in drawing-rooms,&#8221; he airily
amended. &#8220;But this is God&#8217;s open and untrammeled
prairie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where crudeness is king,&#8221; I added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where candor is worth more than convention,&#8221; he
corrected, with rather a wistful look in his eye. &#8220;And
where we mortals ought to be at least as urbane as
that really wonderful robin-egg sky up there with the
chinook arch across it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t flippant any more, and I had a sense of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
triumph in forcing his return to sobriety. I wanted to
ask him what his name was, once we were back to earth
again. But as that seemed a little too direct, I merely
inquired where his home happened to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just come from up North!&#8221; he said. And
that, I promptly realized, was an evasive way of
answering an honest question, especially as there was
a California license-number on the front of his car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s your business?&#8221; I inquired, deciding to
try him out with still one more honest question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a windmill man,&#8221; he told me, as he waded in
toward his dejected-looking automobile and lifted up
its hood. I took him literally, for there wasn&#8217;t anything,
at the time, to make me think of Cervantes.
But I&#8217;d already noticed his hands, and I felt sure they
weren&#8217;t the hands of a laboring man. They were long
and lean and finicky-fingered hands, the sort that could
span an octave much better than they could hold a
hayfork. And I decided to see him hoisted by his own
petard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re just the man I&#8217;m looking for,&#8221; I told
him. He stopped for a moment to look up from the
bit of heavy rubber-hose he was winding with a stretch
of rubber that looked as though it had been cut from
an inner tube.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Words such as those are honey to my ears,&#8221; he
said as he went on with his work. And I saw it was
necessary to yank him down to earth again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a broken-down windmill over on my ranch,&#8221;
I told him. &#8220;And if you&#8217;re what you say you are, you
ought to be able to put it in running order for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve a ranch?&#8221; he observed, stopping in
his work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A ranch and a husband and three children,&#8221; I told
him with the well-paraded air of a tabby-cat who&#8217;s
dragged her last mouse into the drawing-room. But
my announcement didn&#8217;t produce the effect I&#8217;d counted
on. All I could see on the face of the windmill man
was a sort of mild perplexity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That only deepens the mystery,&#8221; he observed, apparently
as much to himself as to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What mystery?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he retorted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with me?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so absurdly alive and audacious and sensitive
and youthful-hearted, dear madam! For the life
of me I can&#8217;t quite fit you into the narrow little frame
you mention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so narrow?&#8221; I inquired, wondering why I
wasn&#8217;t much more indignant at him. But instead of
answering that question, he asked me another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t this husband of yours fixed the windmill?&#8221;
he casually asked over his shoulder, as he resumed
his tinkering on the car-engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband&#8217;s work keeps him away from home,&#8221;
I explained, promptly on the defensive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; he announced, with the expression
of a man who&#8217;s had a pet hypothesis unexpectedly
confirmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what made you think so?&#8221; I demanded, with
a feeling that he was in some way being subtler than
I could quite comprehend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Instinct&mdash;if you care to call it that,&#8221; he said as
he stooped low over his engine. He seemed offensively
busy there for a considerable length of time. I could
see that he was not what in the old days I&#8217;d have
called a window-dresser. And I rather liked that
pretense of candor in his make-up, just as I cottoned
to that melodious drawl of his, not altogether unlike
Lady Alicia&#8217;s, with its untoward suggestion of power
and privilege. He was a man with a mind of his own;
there was no denying that. I was even compelled to
remind myself that with all his coolness and suavity
he was still a car-thief, or perhaps something worse.
And I had no intention of sitting there and watching
him pitch shut-out ball.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; I asked, after
he&#8217;d finished his job of bailing ditch-water into his
car-radiator with a little collapsible canvas bucket.
</p>
<p>He climbed into his driving-seat, mud to the knees,
before he answered me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get Hyacinthe out of this hole,&#8221; was
what he said. &#8220;And then I&#8217;m going to fix that windmill!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On what terms?&#8221; I inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with a month&#8217;s board and
keep?&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>It rather took my breath away, but I tried not to
betray the fact. He <i>was</i> a refugee, after all, and only
too anxious to go into hiding for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you milk?&#8221; I demanded, deciding to keep him
in his place, from the start. And he sadly acknowledged
that he wasn&#8217;t able to milk. Windmill men seldom
were, he casually asserted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to make yourself handy, in other
ways,&#8221; I proclaimed as he sat appraising me from his
deep-padded car-seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, as though the whole thing were
settled, on the spot. But it wasn&#8217;t so simple as it
seemed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about this car?&#8221; I demanded. His eye met
mine; and I made note of the fact that he was compelled
to look away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we&#8217;ll have to hide it somewhere,&#8221; he
finally acknowledged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how&#8217;ll you hide a car of that size on the open
prairie?&#8221; I inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we bury it?&#8221; he asked with child-like simplicity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty well that way now, isn&#8217;t it? But I saw
it three miles off,&#8221; I reminded him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we pile a load of prairie-hay over it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
he suggested next, with the natural cunning of the
criminal. &#8220;Then they&#8217;d never suspect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspect what?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspect where we got it,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly do not include me in any of your activities
of this nature,&#8221; I said with all the dignity that Paddy
would permit of, for he was getting restless by this
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve included yourself in the secret,&#8221; he
tried to argue, with a show of injured feelings. &#8220;And
surely, after you&#8217;ve wormed that out of me, you&#8217;re
not going to deliver a poor devil over to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have perfect confidence in me,&#8221; I interrupted,
trying to be stately but only succeeding, I&#8217;m
afraid, in being stiff. And he nodded and laughed
in a companionable and <i>laisser-faire</i> sort of way as
he started his engine and took command of the wheel.
</p>
<p>Then began a battle which I had to watch from a
distance because Paddy evinced no love for that purring
and whining thing of steel as it rumbled and
roared and thrashed and churned up the mud at its
flying heels. It made the muskeg look like a gargantuan
cake-batter, in which it seemed to float as
dignified and imperturbable as a schooner in a canal-lock.
But the man at the wheel kept his temper, and
reversed, and writhed forward, and reversed again.
He even waved at me, in a grim sort of gaiety, as he
rested his engine and then went back to the struggle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
He kept engaging and releasing his clutch until he
was able to impart a slight rocking movement to the
car. And again the big motor roared and churned up
the mud and again Paddy took to prancing and
pirouetting like a two-year-old. But this time the
spinning rear wheels appeared to get a trace of traction,
flimsy as it was, for the throbbing gray mass
moved forward a little, subsided again, and once more
nosed a few inches ahead. Then the engine whined
in a still higher key, and slowly but surely that mud-covered
mass emerged from the swale that had sought
to engulf and possess it, emerged slowly and awkwardly,
like a dinosauros emerging from its primeval
ooze.
</p>
<p>The man in the car stepped down from his driving-seat,
once he was sure of firm ground under his wheels
again, and walked slowly and wistfully about his resurrected
devil-wagon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wages of sin is mud,&#8221; he said as I trotted up
to him. &#8220;And how much better it would have been,
O Singing Pine-Tree, if I&#8217;d never taken that car!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The poor chap was undoubtedly a little wrong in
the head, but likable withal, and not ill-favored in
appearance, and a man that one should try to make
allowances for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been much better,&#8221; I agreed, wondering
how long it would be before the Mounted Police
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
would be tracking him down and turning him to making
brooms in the prison-factory at Welrina.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll kindly trot ahead,&#8221; he announced
as he relighted his little briar pipe, &#8220;and show me the
trail to the ranch of the blighted windmill, I&#8217;ll idle
along behind you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I resented the placidity with which he was accepting
a situation that should have called for considerable
meekness on his part. And I sat there for a
silent moment or two on Paddy, to make that resentment
quite obvious to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; I asked, the same as I&#8217;d ask
the name of any new help that arrived at Alabama
Ranch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Ketley,&#8221; he said, for once both direct and
sober-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Peter,&#8221; I said, as condescendingly as I
was able. &#8220;Just follow along, and I&#8217;ll show you where
the bunk-house is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was his grin, I suppose, that irritated me. So
I started off on Paddy and went like the wind. I don&#8217;t
know whether he called it idling or not, but once or
twice when I glanced back at him that touring-car was
bounding like a reindeer over some of the rougher
places in the trail, and I rather fancy it got some of
the mud shaken off its running-gear before it pulled
up behind the upper stable at Alabama Ranch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You ride like a <i>ritt-meister</i>,&#8221; he said, with an approvingly
good-natured wag of the head, as he came
up as close as Paddy would permit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Danke-schön!</i>&#8221; I rather listlessly retorted, &#8220;And
if you leave the car here, close beside this hay-stack,
it&#8217;ll probably not be seen until after dinner. Then
some time this afternoon, if the coast is clear, you can
get it covered up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was a little sorry, the next moment, that I&#8217;d
harped still again on an act which must have become
painful for him to remember, since I could see his
face work and his eye betray a tendency to evade mine.
But he thanked me, and explained that he was entirely
in my hands.
</p>
<p>Such being the case, I was more excited than I&#8217;d
have been willing to admit when I led him into the
shack. Frontier life had long since taught me not
to depend too much on appearances, but the right
sort of people, the people who out here are called
&#8220;good leather,&#8221; would remain the right sort of people
in even the roughest wickiup. We may have been
merely ranchers, but I didn&#8217;t want Peter, whatever
his morals, to think that we ate our food raw off the
bone and made fire by rubbing sticks together.
</p>
<p>Yet he must have come pretty close to believing
that, unimpeachable as his manners remained, for
Whinnie had burned the roast of veal to a charry mass,
the Twins were crying like mad, and Dinkie had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
painted himself and most of the dining-room table
with Worcestershire sauce. I showed Peter where he
could wash up and where he could find a whisk to remove
the dried mud from his person. Then I hurriedly
appeased my complaining bairns, opened a can
of beans to take the place of Whinnie&#8217;s boiled potatoes,
which most unmistakably tasted of yellow soap,
and supplemented what looked dishearteningly like a
Dixon dinner with my last carefully treasured jar of
raspberry preserve.
</p>
<p>Whinstane Sandy, it is true, remained as glum and
silent as a glacier through all that meal. But my
new man, Peter, talked easily and uninterruptedly.
And he talked amazingly well. He talked about mountain
goats, and the Morgan rose-jars in the Metropolitan,
and why he disliked George Moore, and the difference
between English and American slang, and why
English women always wear the wrong sort of hats,
and the poetry in Indian names if we only had the
brains to understand &#8217;em, and how the wheat I&#8217;d manufactured
my home-made bread out of was made up
of cellulose and germ and endosperm, and how the alcohol
and carbonic acid gas of the fermented yeast
affected the gluten, and how the woman who could
make bread like that ought to have a specially designed
decoration pinned on her apron-front. Then
he played &#8220;Paddy-cake, paddy-cake, Baker&#8217;s man,&#8221;
with Dinkie, who took to him at once, and when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
came back from getting the extra cot ready in the
bunk-house, my infant prodigy was on the new hired
man&#8217;s back, circling the dinner-table and shouting
&#8220;Gid-dap, &#8217;ossie, gid-dap!&#8221; as he went, a proceeding
which left the seamed old face of Whinstane Sandy
about as blithe as a coffin-lid. So I coldly informed
the newcomer that I&#8217;d show him where he could put his
things, if he had any, before we went out to look over
the windmill. And Peter rather astonished me by
lugging back from the motor-car so discreetly left in
the rear a huge suit-case of pliable pigskin that
looked like a steamer-trunk with carrying-handles attached
to it, a laprobe lined with beaver, a llama-wool
sweater made like a Norfolk-jacket, a chamois-lined
ulster, a couple of plaid woolen rugs, and a lunch-kit
in a neatly embossed leather case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a bit of loot, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, a little red in
the face from the effort of portaging so pretentious a
load.
</p>
<p>That word &#8220;loot&#8221; stuck in my craw. It was a painful
reminder of something that I&#8217;d been trying very
hard to forget.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it come with the car?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it came with the car,&#8221; he was compelled to
acknowledge. &#8220;But it would be exhausting, don&#8217;t you
see, to have to tunnel through a hay-stack every time
I wanted a hair-brush!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>I icily agreed that it would, scenting tacit reproof
in that mildly-put observation of his. But I didn&#8217;t
propose to be trifled with. I calmly led Mr. Peter
Ketley out to where the overturned windmill tower
lay like a museum skeleton along its bed of weeds and
asked him just what tools he&#8217;d need. It was a simple
question, predicating a simple answer. Yet he didn&#8217;t
seem able to reply to it. He scratched his close-clipped
pate and said he&#8217;d have to look things over
and study it out. Windmills were tricky things, one
kind demanding this sort of treatment and another
kind demanding that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have no trouble, of course, in raising the
tower?&#8221; I asked, looking him square in the eye. More
than once I&#8217;d seen these windmill towers of galvanized
steel girders put up on the prairie, and I had a very
good idea of how the thing was done. They were assembled
lying on the ground, and then a heavy plank
was bolted to the bottom side of the tower base. This
plank was held in place by two big stakes. Then a
block and tackle was attached to the upper part of the
tower, with the running-rope looped over a tripod of
poles, to act as a fulcrum, so that when a team of
horses was attached to the tackle the tower pivoted on
its base and slowly rose in the air, steadied by a couple
of guy-ropes held out at right angles to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no trouble at all,&#8221; replied the expert quite airily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
But I noticed that his eye held an especially abstracted
and preoccupied expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just how is it done?&#8221; I innocently inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that all depends,&#8221; he sapiently observed.
Then, apparently nettled by my obviously superior
smile, he straightened up and said: &#8220;I want you to
leave this entirely to me. It&#8217;s my problem, and you&#8217;ve
no right to be worried over it. It&#8217;ll take study, of
course, and it&#8217;ll take time. Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a
day. But before I leave you, madam, your tower will
be up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not giving yourself a life sentence,&#8221;
I remarked as I turned and left him.
</p>
<p>I knew that he was looking after me as I went, but
I gave no outer sign of that inner knowledge. I was
equally conscious of his movements, through the shack
window, when he possessed himself of a hay-fork and
with more than one backward look over his shoulder
circled out to where his car still stood. He tooled it
still closer up beside the hay-stack, which he mounted,
and then calmly and cold-bloodedly buried under a
huge mound of sun-cured prairie-grass that relic of a
past crime which he seemed only too willing to obliterate.
</p>
<p>But he was callous, I could see, for once that telltale
car was out of sight, he appeared much more interested
in the water-blisters on his hands than the
stain on his character. I could even see him inspect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
his fingers, from time to time, as he tried to round
off the top of his very badly made stack, and test the
joints by opening and closing them, as though not
quite sure they were still in working order. And when
the stack-making was finished and he returned to the
windmill, circling about the fallen tower and examining
its mechanism and stepping off its dimensions, I
noticed that he kept feeling the small of his back and
glancing toward the stack in what seemed an attitude
of resentment.
</p>
<p>When Whinnie came in with one of the teams, after
his day a-field, I noticed that Peter approached him
blithely and attempted to draw him into secret consultation.
But Whinnie, as far as I could see, had no
palate for converse with suspicious-looking strangers.
He walked several times, in fact, about that mysterious
new hay-stack, and moved shackward more dour
and silent than ever. So that evening the worthy
Peter was a bit silent and self-contained, retiring early,
though I strongly suspected, and still suspect, that
he&#8217;d locked himself in the bunk-house to remove unobserved
all the labels from his underwear.
</p>
<p>In the morning his appearance was not that of a
man at peace with his own soul. He even asked me if
he might have a horse and rig to go in to the nearest
town for some new parts which he&#8217;d need for the
windmill. And he further inquired if I&#8217;d mind him
bringing back a tent to sleep in.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find the bunk-house uncomfortable?&#8221; I
asked, noticing again the heavy look about his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the bunk-house,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s that
old Caledonian saw-mill with the rock-ribbed face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Whinnie?&#8221; I demanded,
with a quick touch of resentment. And Peter looked
up in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean you&#8217;ve never heard him&mdash;and your
shack not sixty paces away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard him what?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Heard him snore</i>,&#8221; explained Peter, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I inquired, remembering the mornings
when I&#8217;d had occasion to waken Whinnie, always
to find him sleeping as silent and placid as one of my
own babies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had eight hours of it in which to dissipate any
doubts,&#8221; he pointedly explained.
</p>
<p>This mystified me, but to object to the tent, of
course, would have been picayune. I had just the
faintest of suspicions, however, that the fair Peter
might never return from Buckhorn, though I tried to
solace myself with the thought that the motor-car and
the beaver-lined lap-robe would at least remain with
me. But my fears were groundless. Before supper-time
Peter was back in high spirits, with the needed new
parts for the windmill, and an outfit of blue denim
apparel for himself, and a little red sweater for Dinkie,
and an armful of magazines for myself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>Whinnie, as he stood watching Peter&#8217;s return, clearly
betrayed the disappointment which that return involved.
He said nothing, but when he saw my eye
upon him he gazed dourly toward his approaching
rival and tapped a weather-beaten brow with one
stubby finger. He meant, of course, that Peter was
a little locoed.
</p>
<p>But Peter is not. He is remarkably clear-headed
and quick-thoughted, and if there&#8217;s any madness about
him it&#8217;s a madness with a deep-laid method. The one
thing that annoys me is that he keeps me so continuously
and yet so obliquely under observation. He
pretends to be studying out my windmill, but he is
really trying to study out its owner. Whinnie, I
know, won&#8217;t help him much. And I refuse to rise to
his gaudiest flies. So he&#8217;s still puzzling over what he
regards as an anomaly, a farmerette who knows the
difference between De Bussey and a side-delivery horse-rake,
a mother of three children who can ride a pinto
and play a banjo, a clodhopper in petticoats who can
talk about Ragusa and Toarmina and the summer
races at Piping Rock. But it&#8217;s a relief to converse
about something besides summer-fallowing and breaking
and seed-wheat and tractor-oil and cows&#8217; teats.
And it&#8217;s a stroke of luck to capture a farm-hand who
can freshen you up on foreign opera at the same time
that he campaigns against the domestic weed!

<h2><i>Thursday the Eleventh</i></h2>
</div>

<p>We are a peaceful and humdrum family, very different
from the westerners of the romantic movies.
If we were the cinema kind of ranchers Pee-Wee would
be cutting his teeth on a six-shooter, little Dinkie
would be off rustling cattle, Poppsy would be away
holding up the Transcontinental Limited, and Mummsie
would be wearing chaps, toting a gun, and pretending
to the sheriff that her jail-breaking brother was
<i>not</i> hidden in the cellar!
</p>
<p>Whereas, we are a good deal like the easterners who
till the soil and try to make a home for themselves and
their children, only we are without a great many of
their conveniences, even though we do beat them out
in the matter of soil. But breaking sod isn&#8217;t so picturesque
as breaking laws, and a plow-handle isn&#8217;t so
thrilling to the eye as a shooting-iron, so it&#8217;s mostly
the blood-and-thunder type of westerners, from the
ranch with the cow-brand name, who goes ki-yi-ing
through picture and story, advertising us as an aggregation
of train-robbers and road-agents and sheriff-rabbits.
And it&#8217;s a type that makes me tired.
</p>
<p>The open range, let it be remembered, is gone, and
the cowboy is going after it. Even the broncho, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
tell me, is destined to disappear. It seems hard to
think that the mustang will be no more, the mustang
which Dinky-Dunk once told me was the descendant
of the three hundred Arab and Spanish horses which
Cortez first carried across the Atlantic to Mexico. For
we, the newcomers, mesh the open range with our barb-wire,
and bring in what Mrs. Eagle-Moccasin called
our &#8220;stink-wagon&#8221; to turn the grass upside down and
grow wheat-berries where the buffalo once wallowed.
But sometimes, even in this newfangled work-a-day
world, I find a fresh spirit of romance, quite as glamorous,
if one has only the eye to see it, as the romance
of the past. In one generation, almost, we are making
a home-land out of a wilderness, we are conjuring up
cities and threading the continent with steel, we are
feeding the world on the best and cleanest wheat
known to hungry man. And on these clear and opaline
mornings when I see the prairie-floor waving with its
harvest to be, and hear the clack and stutter of the
tractor breaking sod on the outer quarter and leaving
behind it the serried furrows of umber, I feel there is
something primal and poetic in the picture, something
mysteriously moving and epic....
</p>
<p>The weather has turned quite warm again, with
glorious spring days of winy and heart-tugging sunlight
and cool and starry nights. In my spare time
I&#8217;ve been helping Whinnie get in my &#8220;truck&#8221; garden,
and Peter, who has reluctantly forsaken the windmill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
and learned to run the tractor, is breaking sod and
summer-fallowing for me. For there is always another
season to think of, and I don&#8217;t want the tin-can
of failure tied to my spirit&#8217;s tail. As I say, the days
slip by. Morning comes, fresh as a new-minted nickel,
we mount the treadmill, and somebody rolls the big
red ball off the table and it&#8217;s night again. But open-air
work leaves me healthy, my children grow a-pace,
and I should be most happy.
</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so homesick for something which I can&#8217;t quite
define that it gives me a misty sort of ache just under
the fifth rib. It&#8217;s just three weeks now since Dinky-Dunk
has ventured over from Casa Grande. If this
aloofness continues, he&#8217;ll soon need to be formally introduced
to his own offspring when he sees them.
</p>
<p>Now that I have Peter out working on the land, I
can safely give a little more time to my household.
But meals are still more or less a scramble. Peter has
ventured the opinion that he might get a Chinaman
for me, if he could have a week off to root out the
right sort of Chink. But I prefer that Peter sticks
to his tractor, much as I need help in the house.
</p>
<p>My new hired man is still a good deal of a mystery
to me, just as I seem to remain a good deal of a mystery
to him. I&#8217;ve been asking myself just why it is
that Peter is so easy to get along with, and why, in
some indescribable way, he has added to the color of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
life since coming to Alabama Ranch. It&#8217;s mostly, I
think, because he&#8217;s supplied me with the one thing I
had sorely missed, without being quite conscious of it.
He has been able to give me mental companionship,
at a time when my mind was starving for an idea or
two beyond the daily drudgery of farm-work. He has
given a fillip to existence, loath as I am to acknowledge
it. He&#8217;s served to knock the moss off my soul by
more or less indirectly reminding me that all work and
no play could make Chaddie McKail a very dull girl
indeed.
</p>
<p>I was rather afraid, at one time, that he was going
to spoil it all by making love to me, after the manner
of young Bud Dyruff, from the Cowen Ranch, who,
because I waded bare-kneed into a warm little slough-end
when the horses were having their noonday meal,
assumed that I could be persuaded to wade with equal
celerity into indiscriminate affection. That rudimentary
and ingenuous youth, in fact, became more and
more offensive in his approaches, until finally I turned
on him. &#8220;Are you trying to make love to me?&#8221; I demanded.
&#8220;The surest thing you know,&#8221; he said with a
rather moonish smile. &#8220;Then let me tell you something,&#8221;
I hissed out at him, with my nose within six
inches of his, &#8220;I&#8217;m a high-strung hell-cat, I am. I&#8217;m
a bob-cat, and I&#8217;m not aching to be pawed by you or
any other hare-brained he-mutt. So now, right from
this minute, keep your distance! Is that clear? Keep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
your distance, or I&#8217;ll break your head in with this
neck-yoke!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor Bud! That rather blighted the flower of
Bud&#8217;s tender young romance, and to this day he effects
a wide detour when he happens to meet me on the trail
or in the byways of Buckhorn.
</p>
<p>But Peter Ketley is not of the Bud Dyruff type.
He is more complex, and, accordingly, more disturbing.
For I can see admiration in his eye, even though
he no longer expresses it by word of mouth. And there
is something tonic to any woman in knowing that a
man admires her. In my case, in fact, it&#8217;s so tonic that
I&#8217;ve ordered some benzoin and cucumber-cream, and
think a little more about how I&#8217;m doing my hair, and
argue with myself that it&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s own fault if she
runs to seed before she&#8217;s seen thirty. I may be the
mother of three children, but I still have a hankering
after personal power&mdash;and that comes to women
through personal attractiveness, disquieting as it may
be to have to admit it. We can&#8217;t be big strong men
and conquer through force, but our frivolous little
bodies can house the triumphant weaknesses which
make men forget their strength.

<h2><i>Sunday the Fourteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a talk with Peter. It simply <i>had</i> to come,
for we couldn&#8217;t continue to play-act and evade realities.
The time arrived for getting down to brass
tacks. And even now the brass tacks aren&#8217;t as clear-cut
as I&#8217;d like them to be.
</p>
<p>But Peter is not and never was a car-thief. That
beetle-headed suspicion has passed slowly but surely
away, like a snow-man confronted by a too affectionate
sun. It slipped away from me little by little, and
began losing its lines, not so much when I found that
Peter carried a bill-fold and a well-thumbed copy of
<i>Marius The Epicurean</i> and walked about in undergarments
that were expensive enough for a <i>prima
donna</i>, but more because I found myself face to face
with a Peter-Panish sort of honorableness that was
not to be dissembled. So I cornered Peter and put
him through his paces.
</p>
<p>I began by telling him that I didn&#8217;t seem to know
a great deal about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The closed makimono,&#8221; he cryptically retorted,
&#8220;is the symbol of wisdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was ashamed to ask just what that meant, so I
tried another tack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Folks are thrown pretty intimately together, in
this frontier life, like worms in a bait-tin. So they
naturally need to know what they&#8217;re tangled up with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peter, at that, began to look unhappy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me what brought you to
this part of the country?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me what brought <i>you</i> to
this part of the country?&#8221; countered Peter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; I curtly retorted. And that chilled
him perceptibly. But he saw that I was not to be
shuttled aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was interested,&#8221; he explained with a shrug of
finality, &#8220;in the nesting-ground of the Canada goose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you came to the right point,&#8221; I promptly
retorted. &#8220;For <i>I</i> am it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t smile, as I&#8217;d expected him to do. He
seemed to feel that something approaching seriousness
was expected of that talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really came because I was more interested in one
of your earliest settlers,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;This settler,
I might add, came to your province some three million
years ago and is now being exhumed from one of the
cut-banks of the Red Deer River. He belongs to the
Mesozoic order of archisaurian gentlemen known as
<i>Dinosauria</i>, and there&#8217;s about a car-load of him. This
interest in one of your cretaceous dinosaur skeletons
would imply, of course, that I&#8217;m wedded to science.
And I <i>am</i>, though to nothing else. I&#8217;m as free as the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
wind, dear lady, or I wouldn&#8217;t be holidaying here
with a tractor-plow that makes my legs ache and a
prairie Penelope, who, for some reason or other, has
the power of making my heart ache.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verboten!</i>&#8221; I promptly interjected.
</p>
<p>Peter saluted and then sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are things up here even more interesting
than your Edmonton formation,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;But
I was born a Quaker, you see, and I can&#8217;t get rid of
my self-control!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you for that,&#8221; I rather depressed him by
saying. &#8220;For I find that one accepts you, Peter, as
one accepts a climate. You&#8217;re intimate in your very
remoteness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peter looked at me out of a rueful yet ruminative
eye. But Whinnie came forth and grimly announced
that the Twins were going it. So I had to turn
shackward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You really ought to get that car out,&#8221; I called
over my shoulder to him, with a head-nod toward the
hay-stack. And he nodded absently back at me.

<h2><i>Thursday the&mdash;I Can&#8217;t Remember</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk rode over to-day when Peter was bolting
some new wire stuts on the windmill tower and I
was busy dry-picking two polygamous old roosters
which Whinnie had beheaded for me. My husband
attempted an offhand and happy-go-lucky air which,
I very soon saw, was merely a mask to hide his
embarrassment. He even flushed up to the ears when
little Dinkie drew back for a moment or two, as any
child might who didn&#8217;t recognize his own father,
though he later solicitously tiptoed to the sleeping-porch
where the Twins were having their nap, and
remarked that they were growing prodigiously.

<p>It was all rather absurd. But when one member
of this life-partnership business is stiff with constraint,
you can&#8217;t expect the other member to fall on
his neck and weep. And Dinky-Dunk, for all his
nonchalance, looked worried and hollow-eyed. He
was in the saddle again, and headed back for Casa
Grande, when he caught sight of Peter at work on
the windmill. So he loped over to my hired man and
had a talk with him. What they talked about I
couldn&#8217;t tell, of course, but it seemed a casual and
friendly enough conversation. Peter, in his blue-jeans,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
dirt-marked and oil-stained, and with a wrench
in his hand, looked like an I. W. W. agitator who&#8217;d
fallen on evil days.
</p>
<p>I felt tempted to sally forth and reprove Dinky-Dunk
for wasting the time of my hired help. But
that, I remembered in time, might be treading on
rather thin ice, or, what would be even worse, might
seem like snooping. And speaking of snooping,
reminds me that a few nights ago I listened carefully
at the open window of the bunk-house where Whinstane
Sandy was deep in repose. Not a sound, not a
trace of a snore, arose from Whinnie&#8217;s cot.
</p>
<p>So my suspicions were confirmed. That old sourdough
had deliberately lain awake and tried to trumpet
my second man from the precincts which Whinnie
felt he&#8217;d already preempted. He had attempted to
snore poor Peter off the map and away from Alabama
Ranch!

<h2><i>Saturday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The sedatest lives, I suppose, have their occasional
Big Surprises. Life, at any rate, has just treated me
to one. Lady Alicia Newland&#8217;s English maid, known
as Struthers, arrived at Alabama Ranch yesterday
afternoon and asked if I&#8217;d take her in. She&#8217;d had
some words, she said, with her mistress, and didn&#8217;t
propose to be treated like the scum of the earth by
anybody.
</p>
<p>So the inevitable has come about. America, the
liberalizer, has touched the worthy Struthers with
her wand of democracy and transformed her from a
silent machine of service into a Vesuvian female with
a mind and a voice of her own.
</p>
<p>I told Struthers, who was still a bit quavery and
excited, to sit down and we&#8217;d talk the matter over, for
rustling maids, in a land where they&#8217;re as scarce as
hen&#8217;s teeth, is a much graver crime than rustling
cattle. Yet if Lady Allie had taken my husband away
from me, I didn&#8217;t see why, in the name of poetic justice,
I shouldn&#8217;t appropriate her hand-maid.
</p>
<p>And Struthers, I found, was quite definite as to her
intentions. She is an expert needle-woman, can
do plain cooking, and having been a nurse-maid in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
her younger days, is quite capable of looking after
children, even American children. I winced at that,
naturally, and winced still harder when she stipulated
that she must have four o&#8217;clock tea every afternoon,
and every alternate Sunday morning off for the purpose
of &#8220;saging&#8221; her hair, which was a new one on
me. But I weighed the pros and cons, very deliberately,
and discussed her predicament very candidly,
and the result is that Struthers is now duly installed
at Alabama Ranch. Already, in fact, that efficient
hand of hers has left its mark on the shack. Her
muffins this morning were above reproach and to-morrow
we&#8217;re to have Spotted Dog pudding. But
already, I notice, she is casting sidelong glances in
the direction of poor Peter, to whom, this evening at
supper, she deliberately and unquestionably donated
the fairest and fluffiest quarter of the lemon pie. I
have no intention of pumping the lady, but I can see
that there are certain matters pertaining to Casa
Grande which she is not averse to easing her mind of.
I am not quite sure, in fact, that I could find it possible
to lend an ear to the gossipings of a servant.
And yet&mdash;and yet, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to
find out. And dignity may still be slaughtered on the
altar of curiosity.

<h2><i>Sunday the Sixth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had a breathing-spell, I&#8217;ve been sitting
back and mentally taking stock. The showers of
last week have brought the needed moisture for our
wheat, which is looking splendid. Our oats are not
quite so promising, but everything will depend upon
the season. The season, in fact, holds our fate and
our fortune in its lap. Those ninety days that include
June and July and August are the days when the
northwest farmer is forever on tiptoe watching the
weather. It&#8217;s his time of trial, his period of crisis,
when our triple foes of Drought and Hail and Fire
may at any moment creep upon him. It keeps one on
the <i>qui vive</i>, making life a gamble, giving the zest
of the uncertain to existence, and leaving no room for
boredom. It&#8217;s the big drama which even dwarfs the
once momentous emotions of love and hate and jealousy.
For when the Big Rush is on, I&#8217;ve noticed,
husbands are apt to neglect their wives, and lovers
forget their sweethearts, and neighbors their enmities.
Let the world go hang, but before and above
everything else, <i>save your crop!</i>
</p>
<p>Yet, as I was saying, I&#8217;ve been taking stock. It&#8217;s
clear that I should have more cattle. And if all goes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
well, I want a bank-barn, the same as they have in the
East, with cement flooring and modern stalling. And
I&#8217;ve got to comb over my herd, and get rid of the
boarders and hatracks, and acquire a blooded bull for
Alabama Ranch, to improve the strain. Two of my
milkers must go for beef, as well as several scrub
springers which it would be false economy to hold.
I&#8217;ve also got to do something about my hogs. They
are neither &#8220;easy feeders&#8221; nor good bacon types.
With them, too, I want a good sire, a pure-bred Yorkshire
or Berkshire. And I must have cement troughs
and some movable fencing, so that my young shoats
may have pasture-crop. For there is money in pigs,
and no undue labor, provided you have them properly
fenced.
</p>
<p>My chickens, which have been pretty well caring
for themselves, have done as well as could be expected.
I&#8217;ve tried to get early hatchings from my brooders,
for pullets help out with winter eggs when prices are
high, laying double what a yearling does during the
cold months. My yellow-beaks and two-year-olds I
shall kill off as we&#8217;re able to eat them, for an old hen
is a useless and profitless possession and I begin to
understand why lordly man has appropriated that
phrase as a term of contempt for certain of my sex.
I&#8217;m trading in my eggs&mdash;and likewise my butter&mdash;at
Buckhorn, selling the Number One grade and holding
back the Number Twos for home consumption. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
is an amazing quantity of Number Twos, because
of &#8220;stolen nests&#8221; and the lack of proper coops and
runs. But we seem to get away with them all. Dinkie
now loves them and would eat more than one at a time
if I&#8217;d let him.
</p>
<p>The gluttony of the normal healthy three-year-old
child, by the way, is something incredible. Dinkie
reminds me more and more of a robin in cherry-time.
He stuffs sometimes, until his little tummy is as tight
as a drum, and I verily believe he could eat his own
weight in chocolate blanc-mange, if I&#8217;d let him. Eating,
with him, is now a serious business, demanding
no interruptions or distractions. Once he&#8217;s decently
filled, however, his greediness takes the form of
exterior application. He then rejoices to plaster as
much as he can in his hair and ears and on his face,
until he looks like a cross between a hod-carrier and
a Fiji-Islander. And grown men, I&#8217;ve concluded, are
very much the same with their appetite of love. They
come to you with a brave showing of hunger, but
when you&#8217;ve given until no more remains to be given,
they become finicky and capricious, and lose their
interest in the homely old porridge-bowl which looked
all loveliness to them before they had made it
theirs....
</p>
<p>This afternoon, tired of scheming and conceiting
for the future, I had a longing to be frivolous and
care-free. So I got out the old rusty-rimmed banjo,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
tuned her up, and sat on an overturned milk-bucket,
with Dinkie and Bobs and Poppsy and Pee-Wee for
an audience.
</p>
<p>I was leaning back with my knees crossed, strumming
out <i>Turkey in the Straw</i> when Peter walked up
and sat down between Bobs and Dinkie. So I gave
him <i>The Whistling Coon</i>, while the Twins lay there
positively pop-eyed with delight, and he joined in
with me on <i>Dixie</i>, singing in a light and somewhat
throaty baritone. Then we swung on to <i>There&#8217;s a
Hole in the Bottom of the Sea</i>, which must always be
sung to a church-tune, and still later to that dolorous
ballad, <i>Oh, Bury Me Not on the Lone Prair-hee!</i>
Then we tried a whistling duet with banjo accompaniment,
pretty well murdering the Tinker&#8217;s Song
from <i>Robin Hood</i> until Whinstane Sandy, who was
taking his Sabbath bath in the bunk-house, loudly
opened the window and stared out with a dourly
reproving countenance, which said as plain as words:
&#8220;This is nae the day for whustlin&#8217;, folks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But little Dinkie, obviously excited by the music,
shouted &#8220;A-more! A-more!&#8221; so we went on, disregarding
Whinnie and the bunk-house window and Struthers&#8217;
acrid stare from the shack-door. I was in the middle
of Fay Templeton&#8217;s lovely old <i>Rosie, You Are My
Posey</i>, when Lady Alicia rode up, as spick and span
as though she&#8217;d just pranced off Rotten Row. And
as I&#8217;d no intention of showing the white feather to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
her ladyship, I kept right on to the end. Then I
looked up and waved the banjo at her where she sat
stock-still on her mount. There was an enigmatic
look on her face, but she laughed and waved back,
whereupon Peter got up, and helped her dismount as
she threw her reins over the pony&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>I noticed that her eye rested very intently on Peter&#8217;s
face as I introduced him, and he in turn seemed to
size the stately newcomer up in one of those lightning-flash
appraisals of his. Then Lady Allie joined our
circle, and confessed that she&#8217;d been homesick for a
sight of the kiddies, especially Dinkie, whom she took
on her knee and regarded with an oddly wistful and
abstracted manner.
</p>
<p>My hired man, I noticed, was in no way intimidated
by a title in our midst, but wagered that Lady Allie&#8217;s
voice would be a contralto and suggested that we all
try <i>On the Road to Mandalay</i> together. But Lady
Allie acknowledged that she had neither a voice nor
an ear, and would prefer listening. We couldn&#8217;t
remember the words, however, and the song wasn&#8217;t
much of a success. I think the damper came when
Struthers stepped out into full view, encased in my
big bungalow-apron of butcher&#8217;s linen. Lady Alicia,
after the manner of the English, saw her without seeing
her. There wasn&#8217;t the flicker of an eyelash, or a
moment&#8217;s loss of poise. But it seemed too much like
a Banquo at the feast to go on with our banjo-strumming,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
and I attempted to bridge the hiatus by none
too gracefully inquiring how things were getting
along over at Casa Grande. Lady Allie&#8217;s contemplative
eye, I noticed, searched my face to see if there
were any secondary significances to that bland inquiry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything seems to be going nicely,&#8221; she
acknowledged. Then she rather took the wind out of
my sails by adding: &#8220;But I really came over to see if
you wouldn&#8217;t dine with me to-morrow at seven. Bring
the children, of course. And if Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Ketley can
come along, it will be even more delightful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still again I didn&#8217;t intend to be stumped by her
ladyship, so I said that I&#8217;d be charmed, without one
second of hesitation, and Peter, with an assumption of
vast gravity, agreed to come along if he didn&#8217;t have
to wear a stiff collar and a boiled shirt. And he continued
to rag Lady Allie in a manner which seemed
to leave her a little bewildered. But she didn&#8217;t altogether
dislike it, I could see, for Peter has the power
of getting away with that sort of thing.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
<h2><i>Tuesday the Eighth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Lady Alicia&#8217;s dinner is over and done with. I
can&#8217;t say that it was a howling success. And I&#8217;m still
very much in doubt as to its <i>raison d&#8217;être</i>, as the
youthful society reporters express it. At first I
thought it might possibly be to flaunt my lost grandeur
in my face. And then I argued with myself
that it might possibly be to exhibit Sing Lo, the new
Chink man-servant disinterred from one of the Buckhorn
laundries. And still later I suspected that it
might be a sort of demonstration of preparedness,
like those carefully timed naval parades on the part
of one of the great powers disquieted by the activities
of a restive neighbor. And then came still another
suspicion that it might possibly be a move to precipitate
the impalpable, as it were, to put certain family
relationships to the touch, and make finally certain
as to how things stood.
</p>
<p>But that, audacious as I felt Lady Alicia to be,
didn&#8217;t quite hold water. It didn&#8217;t seem any more reasonable
than my earlier theories. And all I&#8217;m really
certain of is that the dinner was badly cooked and
badly served, rather reminding me of a chow-house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
meal on the occasion of a Celestial New Year. We all
wore our every-day clothes (with Peter&#8217;s most carefully
pressed and sponged by the intriguing Struthers)
and the Twins were put asleep up-stairs in their old
nursery and Dinkie was given a place at the table with
two sofa-cushions to prop him up in his armchair (and
acted like a little barbarian) and Peter nearly broke
his neck to make himself as pleasant as possible, chattering
like a magpie and reminding me of a circus-band
trying to make the crowd forget the bareback
rider who&#8217;s just been carried out on a stretcher. But
Constraint was there, all the while, first in the form
of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s unoccupied chair, which remained
that way until dinner was two-thirds through, and
then in the form of Dinky-Dunk himself, whose
explanation about some tractor-work keeping him late
didn&#8217;t quite ring true. His harried look, I must
acknowledge, wore away with the evening, but to me
at least it was only too plain that he was there under
protest.
</p>
<p>I did my utmost to stick to the hale-fellow-well-met
rôle, but it struck me as uncommonly like dancing on
a coffin. And for all his garrulity, I know, Peter was
really watching us with the eye of a hawk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too old a dog,&#8221; I overheard him telling Lady
Alicia, &#8220;ever to be surprised at the crumbling of an
ideal or the disclosure of a skeleton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what prompted that statement, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
had the effect of making Lady Allie go off into one
of her purl-two knit-two trances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you English people,&#8221; I heard him telling
her a little later, &#8220;have a tendency to carry moderation
to excess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand that,&#8221; she said, lighting
what must have been about her seventeenth cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean you&#8217;re all so abnormally normal,&#8221; retorted
Peter&mdash;which impressed me as being both clever and
true. And when Lady Allie, worrying over that
epigram, became as self-immured as a Belgian milk-dog,
Peter cocked an eye at me as a robin cocks an
eye at a fish-worm, and I had the audacity to murmur
across the table at him, &#8220;Lady Barbarina.&#8221; Whereupon
he said back, without batting an eye: &#8220;Yes, I
happen to have read a bit of Henry James.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But dinner came to an end and we had coffee in
what Lady Alicia had rechristened the Lounge, and
then made doleful efforts to be light and airy over
a game of bridge, whereat Dinky-Dunk lost fourteen
dollars of his hard-earned salary and twice I had to
borrow six bits from Peter to even up with Lady
Allie, who was inhospitable enough to remain the
winner of the evening. And I wasn&#8217;t sorry when those
devastating Twins of mine made their voices heard
and thrust before me an undebatable excuse for trekking
homeward. And another theatricality presented
itself when Dinky-Dunk announced that he&#8217;d take us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
back in the car. But we had White-Face and Tumble-Weed
and our sea-going spring-wagon, with plenty
of rugs, and there was no way, of course, of putting
a team and rig in the tonneau. So I made my adieux
and planted Peter meekly in the back seat with little
Dinkie to hold and took the reins myself.
</p>
<p>I started home with a lump in my throat and a
weight in my heart, feeling it really wasn&#8217;t a home
that I was driving toward. But it was one of those
crystal-clear prairie nights when the stars were like
electric-lights shining through cut-glass and the air
was like a razor-blade wrapped in panne-velvet. It
took you out of yourself. It reminded you that you
were only an infinitely small atom in the immensity of
a crowded big world, and that even your big world was
merely a microscopic little mote lost amid its uncounted
millions of sister-motes in the infinitudes of
time and space.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nitchevo!</i>&#8221; I said out loud, as I stopped on the
trail to readjust and wrap the Twins in their rug-lined
laundry-basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; Peter unexpectedly remarked, &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to climb into that front seat with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked, not greatly interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want to talk to you,&#8221; was Peter&#8217;s
answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think I&#8217;d rather not talk,&#8221; I told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; it was his turn to inquire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a rum enough situation as it is?&#8221; I demanded.
For Peter, naturally, had not used his eyes
for nothing that night.
</p>
<p>But Peter didn&#8217;t wait for my permission to climb
into the front seat. He plumped himself down beside
me and sat there with my first-born in his arms and
one-half of the mangy old buffalo-robe pulled up over
his knees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m beginning to see light,&#8221; he said, after
a rather long silence, as we went spanking along the
prairie-trail with the cold air fanning our faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish <i>I</i> did,&#8221; I acknowledged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not very happy, are you?&#8221; he ventured,
in a voice with just the slightest trace of <i>vibrato</i> in it.
</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t see that anything was to be gained by
parading my troubles before others. And life, of
late, had been teaching me to consume my own smoke.
So I kept silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like me, Peter?&#8221; I suddenly asked. For
I felt absurdly safe with Peter. He has a heart, I
know, as clean as an Alpine village, and the very sense
of his remoteness, as I&#8217;d already told him, gives birth
to a sort of intimacy, like the factory girl who throws
a kiss to the brakeman on the through freight and
remains Artemis-on-ice to the delicatessen-youth from
whom she buys her supper &#8220;weenies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose I&#8217;ve been hanging around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
for?&#8221; demanded Peter, with what impressed me as an
absence of finesse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To fix the windmill, of course,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Unless
you have improper designs on Struthers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed a little and looked up at the Great Bear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s true, as they say, that Fate weaves in the
dark, I suppose that&#8217;s why she weaves so badly,&#8221; he
observed, after a short silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She undoubtedly drops a stitch now and then,&#8221; I
agreed, wondering if he was thinking of me or
Struthers when he spoke. &#8220;But you do like me,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I adore you,&#8221; admitted Peter quite simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the face of all these?&#8221; I said with a contented
little laugh, nodding toward my three children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the face of everything,&#8221; asserted Peter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wish you&#8217;d do something for me,&#8221; I
told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Break that woman&#8217;s heart,&#8221; I announced, with a
backward nod of my head toward Casa Grande.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather break <i>yours</i>,&#8221; he coolly contended.
&#8220;Or I&#8217;d prefer knowing I had the power of
doing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I shook my head. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be done, Peter. And
it can&#8217;t even be pretended. Imagine the mother of
twins trying to flirt with a man even as nice as you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
are! It would be as bad as an elephant trying to be
kittenish and about as absurd as one of your dinosauria
getting up and trying to do a two-step. And
I&#8217;m getting old and prosy, Peter, and if I pretend
to be skittish now and then it&#8217;s only to mask the fact
that I&#8217;m on the shelf, that I&#8217;ve eaten my pie and that
before long I&#8217;ll be dyeing my hair every other Sunday,
the same as Struthers, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; interrupted Peter. &#8220;All rot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why rot?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because to me you&#8217;re the embodiment of undying
youth,&#8221; asserted the troubadour beside me. It was
untrue, and it was improper, but for a moment or two
at least my hungry heart closed about that speech
the same as a child&#8217;s hand closes about a chocolate-drop.
Women are made that way. But I had to
keep to the trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing we get back to earth,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the way we were heading?&#8221;
countered the quiet-eyed Peter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem quite right,&#8221; I argued. And he
laughed a little wistfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make, so long as we&#8217;re
happy?&#8221; he inquired. And I tried to reprove him with
a look, but I don&#8217;t think it quite carried in the misty
starlight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;that I approve of your
reasoning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point,&#8221; he said with a slightly
more reckless note in his laughter. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t pretend
to be reasoning. It&#8217;s more like that abandoning
of all reasoning which brings us our few earthly
glories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>,&#8221; I announced, remembering my
Descartes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to keep on just the same,&#8221; protested
Peter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on at what?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At thinking you&#8217;re adorable,&#8221; was his reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the caterpillars have been known to stop the
train, but you must remember that it&#8217;s rather hard on
the caterpillars,&#8221; I proclaimed as we swung off the
trail and headed in for Alabama Ranch.

<h2><i>Sunday the Thirteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>On Friday night there were heavy showers again,
and now Whinnie reports that our Marquis wheat
couldn&#8217;t look better and ought to run well over forty
bushels to the acre. We are assured of sufficient
moisture, but our two enemies yclept Fire and Hail
remain. I should like to have taken out hail insurance,
but I haven&#8217;t the money on hand.
</p>
<p>I can at least make sure of my fire-guards. Turning
those essential furrows will be good training for
Peter. That individual, by the way, has been quieter
and more ruminative of late, and, if I&#8217;m not mistaken,
a little gentler in his attitude toward me. Yet there&#8217;s
not a trace of pose about him, and I feel sure he
wouldn&#8217;t harm the morals of a lady-bug. He&#8217;s kind
and considerate, and doing his best to be a good pal.
Whinnie, by the way, regards me with a mildly
reproving eye, and having apparently concluded that
I am a renegade, is concentrating his affection on
Dinkie, for whom he is whittling out a new Noah&#8217;s
Ark in his spare time. He is also teaching Dinkie to
ride horseback, lifting him up to the back of either
Nip or Tuck when they come for water and letting
him ride as far as the stable. He looks very small
up on that big animal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>At night, now that the evenings are so long,
Whinnie takes my laddie on his knee and tells him
stories, stories which he can&#8217;t possibly understand,
I&#8217;m sure, but Dinkie likes the drone of Whinnie&#8217;s
voice and the feel of those rough old arms about his
little body. We all hunger for affection. The idiot
who said that love was the bitters in the cocktail of
life wasn&#8217;t either a good liver or a good philosopher.
For love is really the whole cocktail. Take that away,
and nothing is left....
</p>
<p>I seem to be getting moodier, as summer advances.
Alternating waves of sourness and tenderness sweep
through me, and if I wasn&#8217;t a busy woman I&#8217;d possibly
make a fine patient for one of those fashionable
nerve-specialists who don&#8217;t flourish on the prairie.
</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t quite succeed in making myself as
miserable as I feel I ought to be. There seems to
be a great deal happening all about us, and yet nothing
ever happens. My children are hale and hearty,
my ranch is fat with its promise of harvest, and I am
surrounded by people who love and respect me. But
it doesn&#8217;t seem enough. Coiled in my heart is one
small disturbing viper which I can neither scotch nor
kill. Yet I decline to be the victim of anything as
ugly as jealousy. For jealousy is both poisonous
and pathetic. But I&#8217;d like to choke that woman!
</p>
<p>Yesterday Lady Alicia, who is now driving her own
car, picked up Peter from his fire-guard work and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
carried him off on an experimental ride to see what
was wrong with her carbureter&mdash;the same old carbureter!
She let him out at the shack, on her way
home, and Struthers witnessed the tail end of that
<i>enlèvement</i>. It spoilt her day for her. She fumed
and fretted and made things fly&mdash;for Struthers
always works hardest, I&#8217;ve noticed, when in a temper&mdash;and
surrendering to the corroding tides which were
turning her gentle nature into gall and wormwood,
obliquely and tremulously warned the somewhat
startled Peter against ungodly and frivolous females
who &#8217;ave no right to be corrupting simple-minded
colonials and who &#8217;ave no scruples against playing
with men the same as a cat would play with a mouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So be warned in time,&#8221; I sternly exclaimed to
Peter, when I accidentally overheard the latter end
of Struthers&#8217; exhortation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are others as ought to be warned in
time!&#8221; was Struthers&#8217; Parthian arrow as she flounced
off to turn the omelette which she&#8217;d left to scorch on
the cook-stove.
</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s eye met mine, but neither of us said anything.
It reminded me of cowboy honor, which
prompts a rider never to &#8220;touch leather,&#8221; no matter
how his bronco may be bucking. And <i>omelette</i>, I was
later reminded, comes from the French <i>alumelle</i>, which
means ship&#8217;s plating, a bit of etymology well authenticated
by Struthers&#8217; skillet.

<h2><i>Wednesday the Twenty-third</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Summer is here, here in earnest, and already we&#8217;ve
had a few scorching days. Haying will soon be upon
us, and there is no slackening in the wheels of industry
about Alabama Ranch. My Little Alarm-Clocks
have me up bright and early, and the morning prairie
is a joy that never grows old to the eye. Life is good,
and I intend to be happy, for

</td></tr></table>

<p>And our miseries, after all, are mostly in our own
minds. Yesterday I came across little Dinkie lamenting
audibly over a scratch on his hand at least seven
days old. He insisted that I should kiss it, and, after
witnessing that healing touch, was perfectly satisfied.
And there&#8217;s no reason why grown-ups should be more
childish than children themselves.
</p>
<p>One thing that I&#8217;ve been missing this year, more
than ever before, is fresh fruit. During the last few
days I&#8217;ve nursed a craving for a tart Northern-Spy
apple, or a Golden Pippin with a water-core, or a
juicy and buttery Bartlett pear fresh from the tree.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Those longings come over me occasionally, like my
periodic hunger for the Great Lakes and the Atlantic,
a vague ache for just one vision of tumbling beryl
water, for the plunge of cool green waves and the
race of foam. And Peter overheard me lamenting our
lack of fruit and proclaiming I could eat my way
right across the Niagara Peninsula in peach time.
So when he came back from Buckhorn this afternoon
with the farm supplies, he brought on his own hook
two small boxes of California plums and a whole crate
of oranges.
</p>
<p>It was very kind of him, and also very foolish, for
the oranges will never keep in this hot weather, and
the only way that I can see to save them is to make
them up into marmalade. It was pathetic to see little
Dinkie with his first orange. It was hard to persuade
him that it wasn&#8217;t a new kind of ball. But once
the flavor of its interior juices was made known to
him, he took to it like a cat to cream.
</p>
<p>It brought home to me how many things there are
my kiddies have had to do without, how much that
is a commonplace to the city child must remain beyond
the reach of the prairie tot. But I&#8217;m not complaining.
I am resolved to be happy, and in my prophetic
bones is a feeling that things are about to take a turn
for the better, something better than the humble
stewed prune for Dinkie&#8217;s little tummy and something
better than the companionship of the hired help for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
his mother. Not that both Peter and Whinnie haven&#8217;t
a warm place in my heart! They couldn&#8217;t be better
to me. But I&#8217;m one of those neck-or-nothing women,
I suppose, who are silly enough to bank all on a
single throw, who have to put all their eggs of affection
in one basket. I can&#8217;t be indiscriminate, like Dinkie,
for instance, whom I found the other day kissing
every picture of a man in the Mail-Order Catalogue
and murmuring &#8220;Da-da!&#8221; and doing the same to every
woman-picture and saying &#8220;Mummy.&#8221; To be lavish
with love is, I suppose, the prerogative of youth. Age
teaches us to treasure it and sustain it, to guard it
as we&#8217;d guard a lonely flame against the winds of
the world. But the flame goes out, and we grope on
through the darkness wondering why there can never
be another....
</p>
<p>I wonder if Lady Alicia is as cold as she seems?
For she has the appearance of keeping her emotions
in an ice-box of indifferency, the same as city florists
keep their flowers chilled for commercial purposes.
Lady Allie, I&#8217;m sure, is fond of my little Dinkie. Yet
there&#8217;s a note of condescension in her affection, for
even in what seems like an impulse of adoration her
exclamation nearly always is &#8220;Oh, you lovable little
rabbit!&#8221; or, if not that, it&#8217;s likely to be &#8220;You adorable
little donkey you!&#8221; She says it very prettily, of
course, setting it to music almost with that melodious
English drawl of hers. She is, she must be, a very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
fascinating woman. But at the first tee, friendship
ends, as the golf-nuts say.
</p>
<p>...I asked Peter the other day what he
regarded as my besetting sin and the brute replied:
&#8220;Topping the box.&#8221; I told him I didn&#8217;t quite get the
idea. &#8220;A passion to produce a good impression,&#8221; he
explained, &#8220;by putting all your biggest mental strawberries
on the top!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds suspiciously like trying to be a Smart
Aleck,&#8221; I retorted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may sound that way, but it isn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re so
mentally alive, I mean, that you&#8217;ve simply got to be
slightly acrobatic. And it&#8217;s as natural, of course, as
a child&#8217;s dancing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Peter is wrong. I&#8217;ve been out of the world
so long that I&#8217;ve a dread of impressing people as
stupid, as being a clodhopper. And if trying hard
not to be thought that is &#8220;topping the box,&#8221; I suppose
I&#8217;m guilty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are also not without vanity,&#8221; Peter judicially
continued. &#8220;But every naturally beautiful
woman has a right to that.&#8221; And I proved Peter&#8217;s
contention by turning shell-pink even under my sunburn
and feeling a warm little runway of pleasure
creep up through my carcass, for the homeliest old
prairie-hen that ever made a pinto shy, I suppose,
loves to be told that she&#8217;s beautiful.
</p>
<p>Peter, of course, is a conscienceless liar, but I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
help liking him, and he&#8217;ll always nest warm in the
ashes of my heart....
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing I must do, as soon as I have the
chance, and that is get in to a dentist and have my
teeth attended to. And now that I&#8217;m so much thinner
I want a new and respectable pair of corsets. I&#8217;ve
been studying my face in the glass, and I can see,
now, what an awful Ananias Peter really is. Struthers,
by the way, observed me in the midst of that inspection,
and, if I&#8217;m not greatly mistaken, indulged in a
sniff. To her, I suppose, I&#8217;m one of those vain
creatures who fall in love with themselves as a child
and perpetuate, thereby, a life romance!

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-sixth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Coming events do <i>not</i> cast their shadows before
them. I was busy in the kitchen this morning, making
marmalade out of what was left of Peter&#8217;s oranges
and contentedly humming <i>Oh, Dry Those Tears</i> when
the earthquake that shook the world from under my
feet occurred.
</p>
<p>The Twins had been bathed and powdered and fed
and put out in their sleeping-box, and Dinkie was
having his morning nap, and Struthers was busy at
the sewing-machine, finishing up the little summer
shirts for Poppsy and Pee-Wee which I&#8217;d begun to
make out of their daddy&#8217;s discarded B. V. D.&#8217;s. It
was a glorious morning with a high-arching pale
blue sky and little baby-lamb cloudlets along the sky-line
and the milk of life running warm and rich in
the bosom of the sleeping earth. And I was bustling
about in my apron of butcher&#8217;s linen, after slicing
oranges on my little maple-wood carving-slab until
the house was aromatic with them, when the sound
of a racing car-engine smote on my ear. I went to
the door with fire in my eye and the long-handled preserving
spoon in my hand, ready to call down destruction
on the pinhead who&#8217;d dare to wake my kiddies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>My visitor, I saw, was Lady Alicia; and I beheld
my broken wash-tub under the front axle of her
motor-car.
</p>
<p>I went out to her, with indignation still in my eye,
but she paid no attention to either that or the tub
itself. She was quite pale, in fact, as she stepped
down from her driving-seat, glanced at her buckskin
gauntlets, and then looked up at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something we may as well face, and face
at once,&#8221; she said, with less of a drawl than usual.
</p>
<p>I waited, without speaking, wondering if she was
referring to the tub. But I could feel my heart contract,
like a leg-muscle with a cramp in it. And we
stood there, face to face, under the flat prairie sunlight,
ridiculously like two cockerels silently estimating
each other&#8217;s intentions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in love with your husband,&#8221; Lady Alicia suddenly
announced, with a bell-like note of challenge in
her voice. &#8220;And I&#8217;d rather like to know what you&#8217;re
going to do about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was able to laugh a little, though the sound of
it seemed foolish in my own startled ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather a coincidence, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I blithely
admitted. &#8220;For so am I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see the Scotch-granite look that came into
the thick-lashed tourmaline eyes. And they&#8217;d be
lovely eyes, I had to admit, if they were only a little
softer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; was her ladyship&#8217;s curt
retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than unfortunate,&#8221; I agreed, &#8220;it&#8217;s extremely
awkward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she snapped, plainly annoyed at my lightness
of tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he can&#8217;t possibly have both of us, you
know&mdash;unless he&#8217;s willing to migrate over to that
Mormon colony at Red-Deer. And even there, I
understand, they&#8217;re not doing it now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this is something much too serious to
joke about,&#8221; Lady Alicia informed me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it strikes me as essentially humorous,&#8221; I
told her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; she countered, &#8220;that it&#8217;s apt to prove
essentially tragic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he happens to be <i>my</i> husband,&#8221; I observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in form, I fancy, if he cares for some one
else,&#8221; was her ladyship&#8217;s deliberate reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he has acknowledged that&mdash;that you&#8217;ve captured
him?&#8221; I inquired, slowly but surely awakening
to the sheer audacity of the lady in the buckskin
gauntlets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that rather&mdash;er&mdash;primitive?&#8221; inquired Lady
Allie, paler than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean coming and squabbling over another
woman&#8217;s husband, I&#8217;d call it distinctly prehistoric,&#8221;
I said with a dangerous little red light dancing before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
my eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s so original that it&#8217;s aboriginal. But
I&#8217;m still at a loss to know just what your motive is,
or what you want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want an end to this intolerable situation,&#8221; my
visitor averred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Intolerable to whom?&#8221; I inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, to Duncan, and to <i>you</i>, if you are the
right sort of woman,&#8221; was Lady Alicia&#8217;s retort. And
still again I was impressed by the colossal egoism of
the woman confronting me, the woman ready to ride
rough-shod over the world, for all her sparkling
veneer of civilization, as long, as she might reach her
own selfish ends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you mention Duncan, I&#8217;d like to ask if
you&#8217;re speaking now as his cousin, or as his mistress?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Alicia&#8217;s stare locked with mine. She was
making a sacrificial effort, I could see, to remain calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m speaking as some one who is slightly interested
in his happiness, and his future,&#8221; was her coldly
intoned reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And has my husband acknowledged that his happiness
and his future remain in your hands?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hate to see him waste his life in a hole
like this,&#8221; said Lady Alicia, not quite answering my
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you brought any great improvement to it?&#8221;
I parried. Yet even as I spoke I stood impressed by
the thought that it was, after all, more than primitive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
It was paleolithic, two prehistoric she-things in combat
for their cave-man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not what I came here to discuss,&#8221; she
replied, with a tug at one of her gauntlets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it would be nearer the mark to say, since
you began by being so plain-spoken, that you came
here to ask me to give you my husband,&#8221; I retorted
as quietly as I could, not because I preferred the soft
pedal, but because I nursed a strong suspicion that
Struthers&#8217; attentive ear was just below the nearest
window-sill.
</p>
<p>Lady Alicia smiled forbearingly, almost pityingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any such donation, I&#8217;m afraid, is no longer your
prerogative,&#8221; she languidly remarked, once more mistress
of herself. &#8220;What I&#8217;m more interested in is
your giving your husband his liberty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I felt like saying that this was precisely what I
had been giving him. But it left too wide an opening.
So I ventured, instead: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard my husband
express a desire for his liberty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too honorable for that,&#8221; remarked my enemy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s an odd kind of honor,&#8221; I icily remarked,
&#8220;that allows you to come here and bicker over a situation
that is so distinctly personal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I&#8217;m not bickering. And I&#8217;m not
rising to any heights of courage which would be
impossible to your husband. It&#8217;s consoling, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
to know how matters stand. And Duncan will probably
act according to his own inclinations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That declaration would have been more inflammatory,
I think, if one small truth hadn&#8217;t gradually
come home to me. In some way, and for some reason,
Lady Alicia Elizabeth Newland was not so sure of
herself as she was pretending to be. She was not so
sure of her position, I began to see, or she would
never have thrown restraint to the winds and come
to me on any such mission.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that counts me out!&#8221; I remarked, with a forlorn
attempt at being facetious. &#8220;If he&#8217;s going to do
as he likes, I don&#8217;t see that you or I have much to say
in the matter. But before he does finally place his
happiness in your hands, I rather think I&#8217;d like to
have a talk with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That remains with Duncan, of course,&#8221; she admitted,
in a strictly qualified tone of triumph, as though
she were secretly worrying over a conquest too incredibly
facile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows, of course, that you came to talk this
over with me?&#8221; I suggested, as though it were an
after-thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had nothing to do with my coming,&#8221; asserted
Lady Alicia.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was your own idea?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely,&#8221; she admitted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then what did you hope to gain?&#8221; I demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t considering my own feelings,&#8221; imperially
acknowledged her ladyship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very noble of you,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;especially
when you bear in mind that you weren&#8217;t considering
mine, either! And what&#8217;s more, Lady Newland,
I may as well tell you right here, and right now,
that you can&#8217;t get anything out of it. I gave up my
home to you, the home I&#8217;d helped make by the work of
my own hands. And I gave up the hope of bringing
up my children as they ought to be brought up. I
even gave up my dignity and my happiness, in the
hope that things could be made to come out straight.
But I&#8217;m not going to give up my husband. Remember
that, I&#8217;m not going to give him up. I don&#8217;t care
what he says or feels, at this particular moment; I&#8217;m
not going to give him up to make a mess of what&#8217;s
left of the rest of his life. He may not know what&#8217;s
ahead of him, <i>but I do</i>! And now that you&#8217;re shown
me just what you are, and just what you&#8217;re ready to
do, I intend to take a hand in this. I intend to fight
you to the last ditch, and to the last drop of the hat!
And if that sounds primitive, as you&#8217;ve already suggested,
it&#8217;ll pay you to remember that you&#8217;re out here
in a primitive country where we&#8217;re apt to do our fighting
in a mighty primitive way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a very grand speech, but it would have been
more impressive, I think, if I hadn&#8217;t been suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
startled by a glimpse of Whinstane Sandy&#8217;s rock-ribbed
face peering from the bunk-house window at
almost the same moment that I distinctly saw the tip
of Struthers&#8217; sage-green coiffure above the nearest
sill of the shack. And it would have been a grander
speech if I&#8217;d stood quite sure as to precisely what it
meant and what I intended to do. Yet it seemed sufficiently
climactic for my visitor, who, after a queenly
and combative stare into what must have looked like
an ecstatically excited Fourth-of-July face, turned
imperially about and swung open the door of her
motor-car. Then she stepped up to the car-seat, as
slowly and deliberately as a sovereign stepping up to
her throne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be so simple as it seems,&#8221; she announced
with great dignity, as she proceeded to start her car.
And the same dignity might have attended her entire
departure, but in the excitement she apparently
flooded her carbureter, and the starter refused to work,
and she pushed and spun and re-throttled and pushed
until she was quite red in the face. And when the
car finally did get under way, the running-gear became
slightly involved with my broken wash-tub and it was
not until the latter was completely and ruthlessly
demolished that the automobile found its right-of-way
undisputed and anything like dignity returned to the
situation.
</p>
<p>I stood there, with the long-handled preserving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
spoon still in my hand, staring after Lady Alicia and
the dust that arose from her car-wheels. I stood there
in a sort of trance, with all the valor gone out of my
bones and that foolish declamation of mine still ringing
in my ears.
</p>
<p>I began to think of all the clever things I might
have said to Lady Alicia Elizabeth Newland. But
the more I thought it over the more desolated I became
in spirit, so that by the time I meandered back to the
shack I had a face as long as a fiddle. And there
I was confronted by a bristling and voluble Struthers,
who acknowledged that she&#8217;d heard what she&#8217;d heard,
and could no longer keep her lips sealed, whether it
was her place to speak or not, and that her ladyship
was not all that she ought to be, not by any manner
of means, or she would never have left England and
hidden herself away in this wilderness of a colony.
</p>
<p>I had been rather preoccupied with my own
thoughts, and paying scant attention to the clattering-tongued
Struthers, up to this point. But the
intimation that Lady Allie was not in the West for
the sake of her health brought me up short. And
Struthers, when I challenged that statement, promptly
announced that the lady in question was no more in
search of health than a tom-cat&#8217;s in search of water
and no more interested in ranching than an ox is interested
in astronomy, seeing as she&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; been co-respondent
in the Allerby and Crewe-Buller divorce case if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
she&#8217;d stayed where the law could have laid a hand on
her, and standing more shamed than ever when Baron
Crewe-Buller shut himself up in his shooting-lodge
and blew his brains out three weeks before her ladyship
had sailed for America, and the papers that full
of the scandal it made it unpleasant for a self-respecting
lady&#8217;s maid to meet her friends of a morning in
Finsbury Park. And as for these newer goings-on,
Struthers had seen what was happening right under
her nose, she had, long before she had the chance to
say so openly by word of mouth, but now that the fat
was in the fire she wasn&#8217;t the kind to sit by and see
those she should be loyal to led about by the nose.
And so forth. And so forth! For just what else the
irate Struthers had to unload from her turbulent
breast I never did know, since at that opportune
moment Dinkie awakened and proceeded to page his
parent with all the strength of his impatient young
lungs.
</p>
<p>By the time I&#8217;d attended to Dinkie and finished my
sadly neglected marmalade&mdash;for humans must eat,
whatever happens&mdash;I&#8217;d made an effort to get some
sort of order back into my shattered world. Yet it
was about Duncan more than any one else that my
thoughts kept clustering and centering. He seemed,
at the moment, oddly beyond either pity or blame.
I thought of him as a victim of his own weakness,
as the prey of a predaceous and unscrupulous woman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
who had intrigued and would continue to intrigue
against his happiness, a woman away from her own
world, a self-complacent and sensual privateer who
for a passing whim, for a momentary appeasement of
her exile, stood ready to sacrifice the last of his self-respect.
She was self-complacent, but she was also
a woman with an unmistakable physical appeal. She
was undeniably attractive, as far as appearances went,
and added to that attractiveness was a dangerous immediacy
of attack, a touch of outlawry, which only too
often wins before resistance can be organized. And
Dinky-Dunk, I kept reminding myself, was at that
dangerous mid-channel period of a man&#8217;s life where
youth and age commingle, where the monotonous middle-years
slip their shackles over his shoulders and
remind him that his days of dalliance are ebbing away.
He awakens to the fact that romance is being left
behind, that the amorous adventure which once meant
so much to him must soon belong to the past, that
he must settle down to his jog-trot of family life.
It&#8217;s the age, I suppose, when any spirited man is
tempted to kick up with a good-by convulsion or two
of romantic adventure, as blind as it is brief and passionate,
sadly like the contortions of a rooster with
its head cut off.
</p>
<p>I tried, as I sat down and struggled to think things
out, to withhold all blame and bitterness. Then I
tried to think of life without Dinky-Dunk. I attempted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
to picture my daily existence with somebody else in
the place that my Diddums had once filled. But I
couldn&#8217;t do it. I couldn&#8217;t forget the old days. I
couldn&#8217;t forget the wide path of life that we&#8217;d traveled
together, and that he was the father of my children&mdash;my
children who will always need him!&mdash;and that
he and he alone had been my torch-bearer into the
tangled wilderness of passion.
</p>
<p>Then I tried to think of life alone, of going solitary
through the rest of my days&mdash;and I knew that
my Maker had left me too warm-blooded and too
dependent on the companionship of a mate ever to
turn back to single harness. I couldn&#8217;t live without
a man. He might be a sorry mix-up of good and bad,
but I, the Eternal Female, would crave him as a mate.
Most women, I knew, were averse to acknowledging
such things; but life has compelled me to be candid
with myself. The tragic part of it all seems that
there should and could be only one man. I had been
right when I had only too carelessly called myself a
neck-or-nothing woman.
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until later that any definite thought of
injustice to me at Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s hands entered my
head, since my attitude toward Dinky-Dunk seemed
to remain oddly maternal, the attitude of the mother
intent on extenuating her own. I even wrung a
ghostly sort of consolation out of remembering that
it was not a young and dewy girl who had imposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
herself on his romantic imagination, for youth and
innocence and chivalric obligation would have brought
a much more dangerous fire to fight. But Lady Alicia,
with all her carefully achieved charm, could scarcely
lay claim to either youth or the other thing. Early
in the morning, I knew, those level dissecting eyes of
hers would look hard, and before her hair was up she&#8217;d
look a little faded, and there&#8217;d be moments of stress
and strain when her naively insolent drawl would jar
on the nerves, like the talk of a spoiled child too intent
on holding the attention of a visitor averse to precocity.
And her disdain of the practical would degenerate
into untidiness, and her clinging-ivyness, if it
clung too much, would probably remind a man in his
reactionary moments of <i>ennui</i> that there are subtler
pursuits than being a wall, even though it&#8217;s a sustaining
wall.
</p>
<p>And somewhere in her make-up was a strain of
cruelty or she would never have come to me the way
she did, and struck at me with an open claw. That
cruelty, quite naturally, could never have been paraded
before my poor old Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s eyes. It would be,
later on, after disillusionment and boredom. Then,
and then only, it would dare to show its ugly head.
So instead of feeling sorry for myself, I began to
feel sorry for my Diddums, even though he was trying
to switch me off like an electric-light. And all of a
sudden I came to a decision.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>I decided to write to Dinky-Dunk. That, I felt,
would be safer than trying to see him. For in a letter
I could say what I wanted to without being stopped
or side-tracked. There would be no danger of accusations
and recriminations, of anger leading to extremes,
of injured pride standing in the path of honesty. It
would be better than talking. And what was more,
it could be done at once, for the mysterious impression
that time was precious, that something ominous was in
the air, had taken hold of me.
</p>
<p>So I wrote to Dinky-Dunk. I did it on two crazy-looking
pages torn out of the back of his old ranch
ledger. I did it without giving much thought to
precisely what I said or exactly how I phrased it,
depending on my heart more than my brain to guide
me in the way I should go. For I knew, in the marrow
of my bones, that it was my last shot, my forlornest
ultimatum, since in it went packed the last shred of
my pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I wrote, &#8220;I hardly know how
to begin, but I surely don&#8217;t need to begin by saying
we haven&#8217;t been hitting it off very well of late. We
seem to have made rather a mess of things, and I suppose
it&#8217;s partly my fault, and the fault of that stupid
pride which keeps us tongue-tied when we should be
honest and open with each other. But I&#8217;ve been feeling
lately that we&#8217;re both skirting a cut-bank with
our eyes blindfolded, and I&#8217;ve faced an incident, trivial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
in itself but momentous in its possibilities, which persuades
me that things can&#8217;t go on as they are. There&#8217;s
too much at stake to let either ruffled nerves or false
modesty&mdash;or whatever you want to call it&mdash;come between
you and the very unhappy woman who still is
your wife. It&#8217;s time, I think, when we both ought to
look everything squarely in the face, for, after all,
we&#8217;ve only one life to live, and if you&#8217;re happy, at this
moment, if you&#8217;re completely and tranquilly happy
as I write this, then I&#8217;ve banked wrong, tragically
wrong, on what I thought you were. For I <i>have</i>
banked on you, Dinky-Dunk, banked about all my
life and happiness&mdash;and it&#8217;s too late to change, even
if I wanted to. I&#8217;m alone in the world, and in a lonely
part of the world, with three small children to look
after, and that as much as anything, I suppose, drives
me to plain speaking and compels me to clear thinking.
But even as I write these words to you, I realize
that it isn&#8217;t really a matter of thought or speech.
It&#8217;s a matter of feeling. And the one thing I feel
is that I need you and want you; that no one, that
nothing, can ever take your place.... I thought
I could write a great deal more. But I find I can&#8217;t.
I seem to have said everything. It <i>is</i> everything,
really. For I love you, Dinky-Dunk, more than
everything in life. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t shown it
very much, of late, but it&#8217;s there, trying to hide
its silly old ostrich-head behind a pebble of hurt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
pride. So let&#8217;s turn the page and start over. Let&#8217;s
start with a clean slate, before we lose the chance.
Come back to me. I&#8217;m very unhappy. I find it hard
to write. It&#8217;s only that big ache in my heart that
allows me to write at all. And I&#8217;ve left a lot of things
unsaid, that I ought to have said, and intended to say,
but this will have to be enough. If there&#8217;s nothing
that speaks up to you, from between these lines, then
there&#8217;s nothing that can hold together, I&#8217;m afraid,
what&#8217;s left of your life and mine. Think this over,
Dinky-Dunk, and answer the way your heart dictates.
But please don&#8217;t keep me waiting too long, for until
I get that answer I&#8217;ll be like a hen on a hot griddle or
Mary Queen of Scots on the morning before she lost
her head, if that&#8217;s more dignified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hardest part of all that letter, I found, was the
ending of it. It took me a long time to decide just
what to sign myself, just how to pilot my pen between
the rocks of candor and dignity. So I ended up by
signing it &#8220;Chaddie&#8221; and nothing more, for already
the fires of emotion had cooled and a perplexed little
reaction of indifferency had set in. It was only a surface-stir,
but it was those surface-stirs, I remembered,
which played such a lamentably important part in
life.
</p>
<p>When Whinstane Sandy came in at noon for his
dinner, a full quarter of an hour ahead of Peter, I
had his meal all ready for him by the time he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
watered and fed his team. I cut that meal short, in
fact, by handing him my carefully sealed letter and
telling him I wanted him to take it straight over to
Casa Grande.
</p>
<p>I knew by his face as I helped him hitch Water-Light
to the buckboard&mdash;for Whinnie&#8217;s foot makes it
hard for him to ride horseback&mdash;that he nursed a
pretty respectable inkling of the situation. He offered
no comments, and he even seemed averse to having his
eye meet mine, but he obviously knew what he knew.
</p>
<p>He was off with a rattle of wheels and a drift of
trail-dust even before Peter and his cool amending eyes
arrived at the shack to &#8220;stoke up&#8221; as he expresses it.
I tried to make Peter believe that nothing was wrong,
and cavorted about with Bobs, and was able to laugh
when Dinkie got some of the new marmalade in his
hair, and explained how we&#8217;d have to take our mower-knives
over to Teetzel&#8217;s to have them ground, and did
my best to direct silent reproofs at the tight-lipped
and tragic-eyed Struthers, who moved about like a
head-mourner not unconscious of her family obligations.
But Peter, I suspect, sniffed something untoward
in the air, for after a long study of my face&mdash;which
made me color a little, in spite of myself&mdash;he
became about as abstracted and solemn-eyed as Struthers
herself.
</p>
<p>To my dying day I shall never forget that wait for
Whinnie to come back. It threatened to become an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
endless one. I felt like Bluebeard&#8217;s wife up in the
watch tower&mdash;no, it was her Sister Anne, wasn&#8217;t it,
who anxiously mounted the tower to search for the
first sign of deliverance? At any rate I felt like Luck&mdash;now
before the Relief, or a prisoner waiting for the
jury to file in, or a gambler standing over an invisible
roulette-table and his last throw, wondering into
what groove the little ivory ball was to run. And
when Whinnie finally appeared his seamed old face
wore such a look of dour satisfaction that for a weak
flutter or two of the heart I thought he&#8217;d brought
Dinky-Dunk straight back with him.
</p>
<p>But that hope didn&#8217;t live long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your maun&#8217;s awa&#8217;,&#8221; said Whinnie, with quite unnecessary
curtness, as he held my own letter out to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s away?&#8221; I echoed in a voice that was just a
wee bit trembly, as I took the note from Whinnie,
&#8220;what do you mean by away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He left three hours ago for Chicago,&#8221; Whinstane
Sandy retorted, still with that grim look of triumph
in his gloomy old eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what could be taking him to Chicago?&#8221; I
rather weakly inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas to see about buyin&#8217; some blooded stock for
the ranch. At least, so her ladyship informed me.
But that&#8217;s nae more than one of her lies, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say, Whinnie?&#8221; I demanded, doing
my best to keep cool.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Naethin&#8217;,&#8221; was Whinnie&#8217;s grim retort. &#8220;&#8217;Twas
me did the sayin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; I asked, disturbed by the
none too gentle look on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was needed to be said,&#8221; that old sour-dough
with the lack-luster eyes quietly informed me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; I repeated, with a quavery
feeling just under my floating ribs, alarmed at the
after-light of audacity that still rested on his face,
like wine-glow on a rocky mountain-tip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said,&#8221; Whinstane Sandy informed me with his old
shoulders thrust back and his stubby forefinger
pointed to within a few inches of my nose, &#8220;I said
that I kenned her and her kind well, havin&#8217; watched
the likes o&#8217; her ridden out o&#8217; Dawson City on a rail
more times than once. I said that she was naethin&#8217;
but a wanton&#8221;&mdash;only this was <i>not</i> the word Whinnie
used&mdash;&#8220;a wanton o&#8217; Babylon and a temptress o&#8217; men
and a corrupter o&#8217; homes out o&#8217; her time and place,
bein&#8217; naught but a soft shinin&#8217; thing that was a mockery
to the guid God who made her and a blight to the
face o&#8217; the open prairie that she was foulin&#8217; with her
presence. I said that she&#8217;d brought shame and sorrow
to a home that had been filled with happiness until
she crept into it like the serpent o&#8217; hell she was, and
seein&#8217; she&#8217;d come into a lonely land where the people
have the trick o&#8217; tryin&#8217; their own cases after their own
way and takin&#8217; when need be justice into their own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
hands, she&#8217;d have one week, one week o&#8217; seven days and
no more, to gather up what belonged to her and take
herself back to the cities o&#8217; shame where she&#8217;d find
more o&#8217; her kind. And if she was not disposed to
hearken a friendly and timely word such as I was
givin&#8217; her, I said, she&#8217;d see herself taken out o&#8217; her
home, and her hoorish body stripped to the skin, and
then tarred and feathered, and ridden on the cap-rail
of a corral-gate out of a settlement that had small
taste for her company!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whinnie!&#8221; I gasped, sitting down out of sheer
weakness, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t say that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said it,&#8221; was Whinnie&#8217;s laconic retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what right had you to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He cut me short with a grunt that was almost disrespectful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I not only said it,&#8221; he triumphantly affirmed, &#8220;but
what&#8217;s more to my likin&#8217;, I made her believe it, leavin&#8217;
her with the mockin&#8217; laugh dead in her eyes and her
face as white as yon table-cover, white to the lips!&#8221;

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-seventh</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been just a little mystified, to-day, by Whinstane
Sandy&#8217;s movements. As soon as breakfast was
over and his chores were done he was off on the trail.
I kept my eye on him as he went, to satisfy myself
that he was not heading for Casa Grande, where no
good could possibly come of his visitations.
</p>
<p>For I&#8217;ve been most emphatic to Whinstane Sandy
in the matter of his delightful little lynch-law program.
There shall be no tarring and feathering of
women by any man in my employ. That may have
been possible in the Klondike in the days of the gold-rush,
but it&#8217;s not possible in this country and this day
of grace&mdash;except in the movies. And life is not so
simple that you can ride its problems away on the
cap-rail from a corral. It&#8217;s unfortunate that that absurd
old sour-dough, for all his good intentions, ever
got in touch with Lady Alicia. I have, in fact,
strictly forbidden him to repeat his visit to Casa
Grande, under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>But a number of things combine to persuade me that
he&#8217;s not being as passive as he pretends. He&#8217;s even
sufficiently forgotten his earlier hostility toward Peter
to engage in long and guarded conversation with that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
gentleman, as the two of them made a pretense of
bolting the new anchor-timbers to the heel of the windmill
tower. So at supper to-night I summoned up
sufficient courage to ask Peter what he knew about the
situation.
</p>
<p>He replied that he knew more than he wanted to,
and more than he relished. That reply proving eminently
unsatisfactory, I further inquired what he
thought of Lady Alicia. He somewhat startled and
shocked me by retorting that according to his own
personal way of thinking she ought to be spanked
until she glowed.
</p>
<p>I was disappointed in Peter about this. I had always
thought of him as on a higher plane than poor
old Whinnie. But he was equally atavistic, once
prejudice had taken possession of him, for what he
suggested must be regarded as not one whit more refined
than tar and feathers. As for myself, I&#8217;d like
to choke her, only I haven&#8217;t the moral courage to admit
it to anybody.
</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the First</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Lady Alicia has announced, I learn through a
Struthers quite pop-eyed with indignation, that it&#8217;s
Peter and I who possibly ought to be tarred and
feathered, if our puritanical community is deciding to
go in for that sort of thing! It is to laugh.
</p>
<p>Her ladyship, I also learn, has purchased about all
the small-arms ammunition in Buckhorn and toted the
same back to Casa Grande in her car. There, in unobstructed
view of the passers-by, she has set up a
target, on which, by the hour together, she coolly and
patiently practises sharpshooting with both rifle and
revolver.
</p>
<p>I admire that woman&#8217;s spunk. And whatever you
may do, you can&#8217;t succeed in bullying the English.
They have too much of the bull-dog breed in their
bones. They&#8217;re always at their best, Peter declares,
when they&#8217;re fighting. &#8220;But from an Englishwoman
trying to be kittenish,&#8221; he fervently added, &#8220;good
Lord, deliver us all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that started us talking about the English.
Peter, of course, is too tolerant to despise his cousins
across the Pond, but he pregnantly reminded me that
Lady Allie had asked him what sort of town Saskatchewan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
was and he had retorted by inquiring if she
was fond of Yonkers, whereupon she&#8217;d looked puzzled
and acknowledged that she&#8217;d never eaten one. For
Peter and Lady Allie, it seems, had had a set-to about
American map-names, which her ladyship had described
as both silly and unsayable, especially the
Indian ones, while Peter had grimly proclaimed that
any people who called Seven-Oaks <i>Snooks</i> and Belvoir
<i>Beever</i> and Ruthven <i>Rivven</i> and Wrottesley <i>Roxly</i>
and Marylebone <i>Marrabun</i> and Wrensfordsley
<i>Wrensley</i> had no right to kick about American pronunciations.
</p>
<p>But Peter is stimulating, even though he does stimulate
you into opposition. So I found myself defending
the English, and especially the Englishman, for
too many of them had made me happy in their lovely
old homes and too many of their sons, æons and æons
ago, had tried to hold my hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Englishman,&#8221; I proclaimed to Peter, &#8220;always
acts as though he quite disapproves of you and
yet he&#8217;ll go to any amount of trouble to do things to
make you happy or comfortable. Then he conceals
his graciousness by being curt about it. Then, when
he&#8217;s at his crankiest, he&#8217;s apt to startle you by saying
the divinest things point-blank in your face, and as
likely as not, after treating you as he would a rather
backward child of whom he rigidly disapproves, he&#8217;ll

directness. He hates swank, of course, for he&#8217;s a
truffle-hound who prefers digging out his own delicacies.
And it&#8217;s ten to one, if a woman simply sits
tight and listens close and says nothing, that he&#8217;ll say
something about her unrivaled powers of conversation!&#8221;

<h2><i>Sunday the Fourth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Peter, as we sat out beside the corral on an empty
packing-case to-night after supper, said that civilization
was a curse. &#8220;Look what it&#8217;s doing to your noble
Red Man right here in your midst! There was a time,
when a brave died, they handsomely killed that dead
brave&#8217;s favorite horse, feeling he would course the
plains of Heaven in peace. Now, I find, they have
their doubts, and they pick out a dying old bone-yard
whose day is over, or an outlaw that nobody can break
and ride. And form without faith is a mockery. It&#8217;s
the same with us whites. Here we are, us two, with&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I stopped Peter. I had no wish to slide on
rubber-ice just for the sake of seeing it bend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you imagine anything lovelier,&#8221; I remarked
as a derailer, &#8220;than the prairie at this time of the year,
and this time of day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peter followed my eye out over the undulating and
uncounted acres of sage-green grain with an eternity
of opal light behind them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of LaVérendrye, who was their Columbus,&#8221;
he meditated aloud. &#8220;Going on and on, day by day,
week by week, wondering what was beyond that world
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
of plain and slough and coulée and everlasting green!
And they tell me there&#8217;s four hundred million arable
acres of it. I wonder if old Vérendrye ever had an
inkling of what Whittier felt later on:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8216;I hear the tread of pioneers,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Of cities yet to be&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The first low wash of waves where soon</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Shall roll a human sea.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then Peter went on to say that Bryant had given
him an entirely false idea of the prairie, since from the
Bryant poem he&#8217;d expected to see grass up to his armpits.
And he&#8217;d been disappointed, too, by the scarcity
of birds and flowers.
</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t let that complaint go by unchallenged.
I told him of our range-lilies and foxglove
and buffalo-beans and yellow crowfoot and wild sunflowers
and prairie-roses and crocuses and even violets
in some sections. &#8220;And the prairie-grasses, Peter&mdash;don&#8217;t
forget the prairie-grasses,&#8221; I concluded, perplexed
for a moment by the rather grim smile that
crept up into his rather solemn old Peter-Panish face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>For to-morrow, I remembered, Peter is going off to
cut hay. He has been speaking of it as going into the
wilderness for meditation. But what he&#8217;s really doing
is taking a team and his tent and supplies and staying
with that hay until it&#8217;s cut, cut and &#8220;<i>collected</i>,&#8221; to use
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the word which the naive Lady Allie introduced into
these parts.
</p>
<p>I have a suspicion that it is the wagging of tongues
that&#8217;s sending Peter out into his wilderness. But I&#8217;ve
been busy getting his grub-box ready and I can at
least see that he fares well. For whatever happens,
we must have hay. And before long, since we&#8217;re to go
in more and more for live stock, we must have a silo
at Alabama Ranch. Now that the open range is a
thing of the past, in this part of the country at least,
the silo is the natural solution of the cattle-feed problem.
It means we can double our stock, which is rather
like getting another farm for nothing, especially as
the peas and oats we can grow for ensilage purposes
give such enormous yields on this soil of ours.

</div>

<p>For the second time the unexpected has happened.
Lady Alicia has gone. She&#8217;s off, bag and baggage,
and has left the redoubtable Sing Lo in charge of
Casa Grande.
</p>
<p>Her ladyship waited until one full day after the
time-limit imposed upon her by Whinstane Sandy in
that barbarous armistice of his, and then, having saved
her face, joined the Broadhursts of Montreal on a
trip to Banff, where she&#8217;ll be more in touch with her
kind and her countrymen. From there, I understand,
she intends visiting the Marquis of Anglesey ranch at
Wallachie.
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what she intends doing about her
property, but it seems to me it doesn&#8217;t show any great
interest in either her crop or her cousin, to decamp
at this particular time. Struthers protests that she&#8217;s
a born gambler, and can&#8217;t live without bridge and
American poker. Banff, accordingly, ought to give
her what she&#8217;s pining for....
</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m too busy to worry about Lady Allie. The
Big Drama of the year is opening on this sun-steeped
plain of plenty, for harvest-time will soon be here and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
we&#8217;ve got to be ready for it. We&#8217;re on the go from
six in the morning until sun-down. We&#8217;re bringing
in Peter&#8217;s crop of hay with the tractor, hauling three
wagon-loads at a time. I make the double trip, getting
back just in time to feed my babies and then
hiking out again. That means we&#8217;re all hitting on
every cylinder. I&#8217;ve no time for either worries or
wishes, though Peter once remarked that life is only
as deep as its desires, and that the measure of our
existence lies in the extent of its wants. That may be
true, in a way, but I haven&#8217;t time to philosophize over
it. Hard work can be more than a narcotic. It&#8217;s
almost an anesthetic. And soil, I&#8217;ve been thinking,
should be the symbol of life here, as it is with the
peasants of Poland. I feel that I&#8217;m getting thinner,
but I&#8217;ve an appetite that I&#8217;m ashamed of, in secret.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, by the way, is not back yet, and
there&#8217;s been no word from him. Struthers is resolute
in her belief that he&#8217;s in hiding somewhere about the
mountain-slopes of Banff. But I am just as resolute
in my scorn for all such suspicions. And yet, and yet,&mdash;if
I wasn&#8217;t so busy I&#8217;d be tempted to hold solemn
days of feasting and supplication that Lady Alicia
Elizabeth Newland might wade out beyond her depth
in the pellucid waters of Lake Louise.

<h2><i>Friday the Sixteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Peter surprised me yesterday by going in to Buckhorn
and bringing out a machinist to work on the
windmill tower. By mid-afternoon they had it ready
for hoisting and rebolting to its new anchor-posts.
So just before supper the team and the block-and-tackle
were hitched on to that attenuated steel skeleton,
Whinnie took one guide rope and I took the other,
and our little Eiffel Tower slowly lifted itself up into
the sky.
</p>
<p>Peter, when it was all over, and the last nut tightened
up, walked about with the triumphant smile of
a Master-Builder who beholds his work completed.
So I said &#8220;Hello, <i>Halvard Solness</i>!&#8221; as I stepped over
to where he stood.
</p>
<p>And he was bright enough to catch it on the wing,
for he quoted back to me, still staring up at the tower-head:
&#8220;From this day forward I will be a free builder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon I carelessly retorted, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s some
parts of Ibsen that I despise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But something in Peter&#8217;s tone and his preoccupation
during supper both worried and perplexed me.
So as soon as I could get away from the shack I went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
out to the windmill tower again. And the small platform
at the end of the sloping little iron ladder looked
so tempting and high above the world that I started
up the galvanized rungs.
</p>
<p>When I was half-way up I stopped and looked
down. It made me dizzy, for prairie life gives you
few chances of getting above the flat floor of your
flat old world. But I was determined to conquer that
feeling, and by keeping my eyes turned up toward the
windmill head I was able to reach the little platform
at the top and sit there with my feet hanging over
and my right arm linked through one of the steel
standards.
</p>
<p>I suppose, as windmills go, it wasn&#8217;t so miraculously
high, but it was amazing how even that moderate altitude
where I found myself could alter one&#8217;s view-point.
I felt like a sailor in a crow&#8217;s-nest, like a sentinel on
a watch-tower, like an eagle poised giddily above the
world. And such a wonderful and wide-flung world it
was, spreading out beneath me in mottled patches of
grape-leaf green and yellow and gold, with a burgundian
riot of color along the western sky-line where the
last orange rind of the sun had just slipped down out
of sight.
</p>
<p>As I stared down at the roof of our shack it looked
small and pitiful, tragically meager to house the tangled
human destinies it was housing. And the fields
where we&#8217;d labored and sweated took on a foreign and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
ghostly coloring, as though they were oblongs on the
face of an alien world, a world with mystery and
beauty and unfathomable pathos about it.
</p>
<p>I was sitting there, with my heels swinging out in
space and an oddly consoling sense of calmness in my
heart, when Peter came out of the shack and started
to cross toward the corral. I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation
to toss my old straw hat down at him.
</p>
<p>He stopped short as it fell within twenty paces of
him, like a meteor out of the sky. Then he turned and
stared up at me. The next minute I saw him knock
out his little briar pipe, put it away in his pocket, and
cross over to the tower.
</p>
<p>I could feel the small vibrations of the steel structure
on which I sat poised, as he mounted the ladder
toward me. And it felt for all the world like sitting on
the brink of Heaven, like a blessed damozel the second,
watching a sister-soul coming up to join you in your
beatitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, isn&#8217;t this taking a chance?&#8221; asked Peter,
a little worried and a little out of breath, as he clambered
up beside me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s glorious!&#8221; I retorted, with a nod toward the
slowly paling sky-line.
</p>
<p>That far and lonely horizon looked as though a fire
of molten gold burned behind the thinnest of mauve
and saffron and purple curtains, a fire that was too
subdued to be actual flame, but more an unearthly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and ethereal radiance, luring the vision on and on
until it brought an odd little sense of desolation to
the heart and made me glad to remember that Peter
was swinging his lanky legs there at my side out over
empty space.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I find,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;that this tower was sold to
a tenderfoot, by the foot. That&#8217;s why it went over.
It was too highfalutin! It was thirty feet taller than
it had any need to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he dropped back into silence.
</p>
<p>I finally became conscious of the fact that Peter,
instead of staring at the sunset, was staring at me.
And I remembered that my hair was half down, trailing
across my nose, and that three distinctly new
freckles had shown themselves that week on the bridge
of that same nose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, but you&#8217;re lovely!&#8221; he said in a half-smothered
and shamefaced sort of whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verboten!</i>&#8221; I reminded him. &#8220;And not so much
the cussing, Peter, as the useless compliments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He said nothing to that, but once more sat staring
out over the twilight prairie for quite a long time.
When he spoke again it was in a quieter and much
more serious tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I may as well tell you,&#8221; he said without
looking at me, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve come into a pretty clear
understanding of the situation here at Alabama
Ranch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of a mix-up, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I suggested, with
an attempt at lightness.
</p>
<p>Peter nodded his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering how long you&#8217;re going to
wait,&#8221; he observed, apparently as much to himself as
to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for what?&#8221; I inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For what you call your mix-up to untangle,&#8221; was
his answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing for me to do but to wait,&#8221; I reminded
him.
</p>
<p>He shook his head in dissent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t waste your life, you know, doing that,&#8221;
he quietly protested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else can I do?&#8221; I asked, disturbed a little by
the absence of color from his face, apparent even in
that uncertain light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s suggested itself, I suppose?&#8221; he ventured,
after a silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing that prompts me into any immediate action,&#8221;
I told him. &#8220;You see, Peter, I&#8217;m rather anchored
by three little hostages down in that little shack
there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That left him silent for another long and brooding
minute or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve wondered,&#8221; he finally said, &#8220;why
I&#8217;ve stuck around here as long as I have?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I nodded, not caring to trust myself to words, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
then, realizing I was doing the wrong thing, I shook
my head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because, from the morning you found me in
that mud-hole, I&#8217;ve just wanted to be near you, to
hear your voice when you spoke, to see the curve of
your lips and the light come and go in your eyes when
you laugh,&#8221; were the words that came ever so slowly
from Peter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted that so much that I&#8217;ve let
about everything else in life go hang. Yet in a
way, and in my own world, I&#8217;m a man of some
little importance. I&#8217;ve been cursed with enough
money, of course, to move about as I wish, and
loaf as I like. But that sort of life isn&#8217;t really
living. I&#8217;m not in the habit, though, of wanting
the things I can&#8217;t have. So what strikes me as
the tragic part of it all is that I couldn&#8217;t have met and
known you when you were as free as I am now. In a
way, you <i>are</i> free, or you ought to be. You&#8217;re a
woman, I think, with arrears of life to make up.
You&#8217;ve struck me, from the very first, as too alive, too
sensitive, too responsive to things, to get the fullest
measure out of life by remaining here on the prairie,
in what are, after all, really pioneer conditions.
You&#8217;ve known the other kind of life, as well as I have,
and it will always be calling to you. And if that call
means anything to you, and the&mdash;the change we&#8217;ve
spoken of is on its way, or for some unexpected reason
has to come, I&#8217;m&mdash;well, I&#8217;m going to take the bit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
in my teeth right here and tell you that I love you
more than you imagine and a good deal more, I suppose,
than the law allows!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pushed my hand aside when I held it up to stop
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may as well say it, for this is as good a time and
place as we&#8217;ll ever have, and I can&#8217;t go around with
my teeth shut on the truth any longer. I know you&#8217;ve
got your three little tots down there, and I love &#8217;em
about as much as you do. And it would seem like
giving a little meaning and purpose to life to know
that I had the chance of doing what I could to make
you and to make them happy. I&#8217;ve&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t let him go on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Peter,&#8221; I cried with a little choke in
my voice which I couldn&#8217;t control. &#8220;It&#8217;s no earthly
use. I&#8217;ve known you liked me, and it&#8217;s given me a
warm little feeling down in one corner of my heart.
But I could never allow it to be more than a corner.
I like you, Peter, and I like you a lot. You&#8217;re wonderful.
In some ways you&#8217;re the most adorable man
I&#8217;ve ever known in all my life. That&#8217;s a dangerous
thing to say, but it&#8217;s the truth and I may as well say
it. It even hurts a little to remember that I&#8217;ve traded
on your chivalry, though that&#8217;s the one thing in life
you <i>can</i> trade on without reproof or demand for repayment.
But as I told you before, I&#8217;m one of those
neck-or-nothing women, one of those single-track
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
women, who can&#8217;t have their tides of traffic going two
ways at once. And if I&#8217;m in a mix-up, or a maelstrom,
or whatever you want to call it, I&#8217;m in it. That&#8217;s
where I belong. It would never, never do to drag an
innocent outsider into that mixed-up mess of life,
simply because I imagined it could make me a little
more comfortable to have him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peter sat thinking over what I&#8217;d said. There were
no heroics, no chest-pounding, no suggestion of romantically
blighted lives and broken hearts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means, of course, that I&#8217;ll have to climb out,&#8221;
Peter finally and very prosaically remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s so apt to leave one of us sailing
under false colors,&#8221; was his somewhat oblique way of
explaining the situation. &#8220;I might have hung on until
something happened, I suppose, if I hadn&#8217;t shown my
hand. And I hadn&#8217;t quite the right to show my hand,
when you take everything into consideration. But
you can&#8217;t always do what you intend to. And life&#8217;s
a little bigger than deportment, anyway, so what&#8217;s
the use of fussing over it? There&#8217;s just one thing,
though, I want to say, before we pull down the shutters
again. I want you to feel that if anything does
happen, if by any mischance things should take a
turn for the worse, or you&#8217;re worried in any way about
the outcome of all this&#8221;&mdash;he indulged in a quiet but
comprehensive hand-wave which embraced the entire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
ranch that lay in the gray light at our feet&mdash;&#8220;I want
you to feel that I&#8217;d be mighty happy to think you&#8217;d
turn to me for&mdash;for help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was getting just a little too serious again, I felt,
and I decided in a bit of a panic to pilot things back
to shallower water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you <i>have</i> helped, Peter,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;Look
at all that hay you cut, and the windmill here, and the
orange marmalade that&#8217;ll make me think of you every
morning!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He leaned a little closer and regarded me with a
quiet and wistful eye. But I refused to look at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing to what I&#8217;d like to do, if you gave
me the chance,&#8221; he observed, settling back against
the tower-standard again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Peter,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;And it&#8217;s nice of you
to say it. But the nicest thing of all is your prodigious
unselfishness, the unselfishness that&#8217;s leaving this
talk of ours kind of&mdash;well, kind of hallowed, and something
we&#8217;ll not be unhappy in remembering, when it
could have so easily turned into something selfishly
mean and ugly and sordid. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re
<i>big</i>. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll always love you for!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down,&#8221; said Peter, all of a sudden. &#8220;It&#8217;s
getting cold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sat staring down at the world to which we had to
return. It seemed a long way off. And the ladder
that led down to it seemed a cobwebby and uncertain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
path for a lady whose heart was still slipping a beat
now and then. Peter apparently read the perplexity
on my face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go down one rung
ahead of you. Even if you did slip, then, I&#8217;ll be there
to hold you up. Come on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We started down, with honest old Peter&#8217;s long arms
clinging to the ladder on either side of me and my
feet following his, step by step, as we went like a newfangled
sort of quadruped down the narrow steel
rungs.
</p>
<p>We were within thirty feet of the ground when I
made ever so slight a misstep and brought Peter up
short. The next moment he&#8217;d caught me up bodily in
his right arm, and to steady myself I let my arms slip
about his neck. I held on there, tight, even after I
knew what I was doing, and let my cheek rest against
the bristly side of his head as we went slowly down to
the bottom of the tower.
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessary, my holding my arms about
Peter&#8217;s neck. It wasn&#8217;t any more necessary than it
was for him to pick me up and carry me the rest of
the way down. It wasn&#8217;t true-to-the-line fair play,
even, when you come to think of it in cold blood, and it
wasn&#8217;t by any manner of means just what sedately
married ladies should do.
</p>
<p>But, if the terrible truth must be told, <i>it was nice</i>.
I think both our hearts were a little hungry for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
love which didn&#8217;t happen to be coming our way, which
the law of man and his Maker alike prohibited. So
we saved our dignity and our self-respect, oddly
enough, by resorting to the shallowest of subterfuges.
And I don&#8217;t care much if it wasn&#8217;t true-to-the-line
ethics. I liked the feel of Peter&#8217;s arm around me,
holding me that way, and I hope he liked that long
and semi-respectable hug I gave him, and that now
and then, later on, in the emptier days of his life, he&#8217;ll
remember it pleasantly, and without a bit of bitterness
in his heart.
</p>
<p>For Alabama Ranch, of course, is going to lose
Peter as soon as he can get away.

<h2><i>Tuesday the Twenty-fourth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Peter is no longer with us. He went yesterday,
much to the open grief of an adoring and heart-broken
Struthers. I stood in the doorway as he drove off, pretending
to mop my eyes with my hankie and then making
a show of wringing the brine out of it. He
laughed at this bit of play-acting, but it was rather
a melancholy laugh. Struthers, however, was quite
snappy for the rest of the morning, having apparently
construed my innocent pantomime as a burlesque
of her tendency to sniffle a little.
</p>
<p>I never quite knew how much we&#8217;d miss Peter until
he was gone, and gone for good. Even Dinkie was
strangely moody and downcast, and showed his depression
by a waywardness of spirit which reached
its crowning misdemeanor by poking a bean into his
ear.
</p>
<p>This seemed a trivial enough incident, at first. But
the heat and moisture of that little pocket of flesh
caused the bean to swell, and soon had Dinkie crying
with pain. So I renewed my efforts to get that bean
out of the child&#8217;s ear, for by this time he was really
suffering. But I didn&#8217;t succeed. There was no way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
of getting behind it, or getting a hold on it. And
poor Dinkie bawled bitterly, ignorant of why this
pain should be inflicted on him and outraged that his
own mother should add to it by probing about the already
swollen side of his head.
</p>
<p>I was, in fact, getting a bit panicky, and speculating
on how long it would take to get Dinkie in to
Buckhorn and a doctor, when Struthers remembered
about a pair of toilet tweezers she&#8217;d once possessed
herself of, for pulling out an over-punctual gray-hair
or two. Even then I had to resort to heroic measures,
tying the screaming child&#8217;s hands tight to his side with
a bath-towel and having the tremulous Struthers hold
his poor little head flat against the kitchen table.
</p>
<p>It was about as painful, I suppose, as extracting
a tooth, but I finally got a grip on that swollen legume
and pulled it from its inflamed pocket of flesh. I felt
as relieved and triumphant as an obstetrician after a
hard case, and meekly handed over to Dinkie anything
his Royal Highness desired, even to his fifth cookie
and the entire contents of my sewing-basket, which
under ordinary circumstances is strictly taboo. But
once the ear-passage was clear the pain went away,
and Dinkie, at the end of a couple of hours, was himself
again.
</p>
<p>But Peter has left a hole in our lives. I keep feeling
that he&#8217;s merely out on the land and will be coming
in with that quiet and remote smile of his and talking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
like mad through a meal that I always had an incentive
for making a little more tempting than the
ordinary grub-rustling of a clodhopper.
</p>
<p>The only person about Alabama Ranch who seems
undisturbed by Peter&#8217;s departure is Whinstane Sandy.
He reminds me of a decrepit but robustious old rooster
repossessing himself of a chicken-run after the decapitation
of an arrogant and envied rival. He has
with a dour sort of blitheness connected up the windmill
pump, in his spare time, and run a pipe in
through the kitchen wall and rigged up a sink, out of
a galvanized pig-trough. It may not be lovely to the
eye, but it will save many a step about this shack of
ours. And the steps count, now that the season&#8217;s work
is breaking over us like a Jersey surf!

</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve got Struthers in jumpers, and she&#8217;s learning
how to handle a team. Whinnie laughed at her legs,
and said they made him think a-muckle o&#8217; a heron.
But men are scarce in this section, and it looks as
though Alabama Ranch was going to have a real
wheat crop. Whinnie boasts that we&#8217;re three weeks
ahead of Casa Grande, which, they tell me, is taking
on a neglected look.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had no message from my Dinky-Dunk, and no
news of him. All day long, at the back of my brain,
a nervous little mouse of anxiety keeps nibbling and
nibbling away. Last night, when she was helping me
get the Twins ready for bed, Struthers confided to
me that she felt sure Lady Alicia and my husband
had been playmates together in England at one time,
for she&#8217;s heard them talking, and laughing about
things that had happened long ago. But it&#8217;s not the
things that happened long ago that are worrying me.
It&#8217;s the things that may be happening now.
</p>
<p>I wonder what the fair Lady Alicia intends doing
about getting her crop off. Sing Lo will scarcely be
the man to master that problem.... The Lord
knows I&#8217;m busy enough, but I seem to be eternally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
waiting for something. I wonder if every woman&#8217;s
life has a larval period like this? I&#8217;ve my children and
Bobs. Over my heart, all day long, should flow a
deep and steady current of love. But it&#8217;s not the kind
I&#8217;ve a craving for. There&#8217;s something missing. I&#8217;ve
been wondering if Dinky-Dunk, even though he were
here at my side, would still find any &#8220;kick&#8221; in my
kisses. I can&#8217;t understand why he never revealed to
me the fact that he and Lady Allie were playmates
as children. In that case, she must be considerably
older than she looks. But old or young, I wish she&#8217;d
stayed in England with her croquet and pat-tennis
and broom-stick-cricket, instead of coming out here
and majestically announcing that nothing was to be
expected of a country which had no railway porters!

<p>The departed Peter has sent back to us a Victrola
and a neatly packed box of records. Surely that was
kind of him. I suppose he felt that I needed something
more than a banjo to keep my melodious soul
alive. He may be right, for sometimes during these
long and hot and tiring days I feel as though my
spirit had been vitrified and macadamized. But I
haven&#8217;t yet had time to unpack the music-box and get
it in working-order, though I&#8217;ve had a look through
the records. There are quite a number of my old
favorites. I notice among them a song from <i>The
Bohemian Girl</i>. It bears the title of <i>Then You&#8217;ll
Remember Me</i>. Poor old Peter! For when I play it,
I know I&#8217;ll always be thinking of another man.

<p>Life is a club from which Cupid can never be blackballed.
I notice that Struthers, who seems intent on
the capture of a soul-mate, has taken to darning
Whinstane Sandy&#8217;s socks for him. And Whinnie,
who is a bit of a cobbler as well as being a bit of renegade
to the ranks of the misogynists, has put new
heels and soles on the number sevens which Struthers
wears at the extremities of her heron-like limbs. Thus
romance, beginning at the metatarsus, slowly but
surely ascends to the diastolic region!

<p>I&#8217;ve just had a nice little note from Peter, written
from the Aldine Club in Philadelphia, saying he&#8217;d
neglected to mention something which had been on
his mind for some time. He has a slightly rundown
place in the suburbs of Pasadena, he went on to
explain, and as his lazy summer would mean he&#8217;d have
to remain in the East and be an ink-coolie all winter,
the place was at my disposal if it so turned out that
a winter in California seemed desirable for me and
my kiddies. It would, in fact, be a God-send&mdash;so he
protested&mdash;to have somebody dependable lodged in
that empty house, to keep the cobwebs out of the corners
and the mildew off his books and save the whole
disintegrating shebang from the general rack and
ruin which usually overtakes empty mansions of that
type. He gave me the name and address of the caretaker,
on Euclid Avenue, and concluded by saying it
wasn&#8217;t very much of a place, but might be endured
for a winter for the sake of the climate, if I happened
to be looking for a sunnier corner of the world than
Alabama Ranch. He further announced that he&#8217;d
give an arm to see little Dinkie&#8217;s face when that young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
outlaw stole his first ripe orange from the big Valencia
tree in the <i>patio</i>. And Peter, in a post-script, averred
that he could vouch for the flavor of the aforementioned
Valencias.

</div>

<p>Whinstane Sandy about the middle of last week
brought home the startling information that Sing Lo
had sold Lady Allie&#8217;s heavy work-team to Bud
O&#8217;Malley for the paltry sum of sixty dollars. He
further reported that Sing Lo had decamped, taking
with him as rich a haul as he could carry.
</p>
<p>I was in doubt on what to do, for a while. But I
eventually decided to go in to Buckhorn and send a
telegram to the owner of Casa Grande. I felt sure,
if Lady Allie was in Banff, that she&#8217;d be at the
C. P. R. hotel there, and that even if she had gone on
to the Anglesey Ranch my telegram would be forwarded
to Wallachie. So I wired her: &#8220;Chinaman
left in charge has been selling ranch property. Advise
me what action you wish taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A two-day wait brought no reply to this, so I then
telegraphed to the hotel-manager asking for information
as to her ladyship. I was anxious for that
information, I&#8217;ll confess, for more personal reasons
than those arising out of the activities of Sing Lo.
</p>
<p>When I went in for my house supplies on Friday
there was a message there from the Banff hotel-manager
stating that Lady Newland had left, ten days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
before, for the Empress Hotel in Victoria. So I
promptly wired that hotel, only to learn that my titled
wanderer might be found in San Francisco, at the
Hotel St. Francis. So I repeated my message; and
yesterday morning Hy Teetzel, homeward bound from
Buckhorn in his tin Lizzie, brought the long-expected
reply out to me. It read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would advise consulting my ranch manager on
the matter mentioned in your wire,&#8221; and was signed
&#8220;Alicia Newland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sense of satisfaction in having located
the lady, but there was a distinctly nettling note in
the tenor of that little message. I decided, accordingly,
to give her the retort courteous by wiring back
to her: &#8220;Kindly advise me of ranch manager&#8217;s present
whereabouts,&#8221; and at the bottom of that message
inscribed, &#8220;Mrs. Duncan Argyll McKail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been smiling a little at the telegram which
has just been sent on to me, for now that I come to
review our electric intercourse in a cooler frame of
mind it looks suspiciously like back-biting over a thousand
miles of telegraph-wire. This second message
from San Francisco said: &#8220;Have no knowledge whatever
of the gentleman&#8217;s movements or whereabouts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, I found, both a pleasant and a puzzling bit
of information, and my earlier regrets at wasting time
that I could ill spare betrayed a tendency to evaporate.
It was satisfying, and yet it was not satisfying, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
morose little doubts as to the veracity of the lady in
question kept creeping back into my mind. It also
left everything pretty much up in the air, so I&#8217;ve
decided to take things in my own hand and go to Casa
Grande and look things over.

<h2><i>Thursday the Sixteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I didn&#8217;t go over to Casa Grande, after all. For
this morning the news came to me that Duncan had
been back since day before yesterday. And he is
undoubtedly doing anything that needs to be done.
</p>
<p>But the lady lied, after all. That fact now is only
too apparent. And her equerry has been hurried back
to look after her harried estate. The live stock, I hear,
went without water for three whole days, and the poultry
would all have been in kingdom-come if Sing Lo,
in choosing a few choice birds for his private consumption,
hadn&#8217;t happened to leave the run-door
unlatched....
</p>
<p>I was foolish enough to expect, of course, that
Duncan might nurse some slight curiosity as to his
family and its welfare. This will be his third day
back, and he has neither put in an appearance nor
sent a word. He&#8217;s busy, of course, with that tangle
to unravel&mdash;but where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s usually a
way. And hope dies hard. Yet day by day I find
less bitterness in my heart. Those earlier hot tides
of resentment have been succeeded, not by tranquillity
or even indifference, but by a colder and more judicial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
attitude toward things in general. I&#8217;ve got a home
and a family to fight for&mdash;not to mention a baby with
prickly-heat&mdash;and they must not be forgotten. I
have the consolation, too, of knowing that the fight
doesn&#8217;t promise to be a losing one. I&#8217;ve banked on
wheat, and old Mother Earth is not going to betray
me. My grain has ripened miraculously during these
last few weeks of hot dry weather. It&#8217;s <i>too</i> hot, in fact,
for my harvest threatens to come on with a rush. But
we&#8217;ll scramble through it, in some way.

<h2><i>Sunday the Nineteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s only three days since I wrote those last lines.
But it seems a long time back to last Thursday. So
many, many things have happened since then.
</p>
<p>Friday morning broke very hot, and without a
breath of wind. By noon it was stifling. By mid-afternoon
I felt strangely tired, and even more
strangely depressed. I even attempted to shake myself
together, arguing that my condition was purely
mental, for I had remembered that it was unmistakably
Friday, a day of ill-omen to the superstitious.
</p>
<p>I was surprised, between four and five, to see Whinstane
Sandy come in from his work and busy himself
about the stables. When I asked him the reason for
this premature withdrawal he pointed toward a low
and meek-looking bank of clouds just above the southwest
sky-line and announced that we were going to
have a &#8220;blow,&#8221; as he called it.
</p>
<p>I was inclined to doubt this, for the sun was still
shining, there was no trace of a breeze, and the sky
straight over my head was a pellucid pale azure. But,
when I came to notice it, there was an unusual, small
stir among my chickens, the cattle were restless, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
one would occasionally hold its nose high in the air
and then indulge in a lowing sound. Even Bobs
moved peevishly from place to place, plainly disturbed
by more than the flies and the heat. I had a feeling,
myself, of not being able to get enough air into my
lungs, a depressed and disturbed feeling which was
nothing more than the barometer of my body trying
to tell me that the glass was falling, and falling
forebodingly.
</p>
<p>By this time I could see Whinnie&#8217;s cloud-bank rising
higher above the horizon and becoming more
ragged as it mushroomed into anvil-shaped turrets.
Then a sigh or two of hot air, hotter even than the
air about us, disturbed the quietness and made the
level floor of my yellowing wheat undulate a little,
like a breast that has taken a quiet breath or two.
Then faint and far-off came a sound like the leisurely
firing of big guns, becoming quicker and louder as
the ragged arch of the storm crept over the sun and
marched down on us with strange twistings and writhings
and up-boilings of its tawny mane.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d best be makin&#8217; things ready!&#8221; Whinnie called
out to me. But even before I had my windows down
little eddies of dust were circling about the shack.
Then came a long and sucking sigh of wind, followed
by a hot calm too horrible to be endured, a hot calm
from the stifling center of which your spirit cried
out for whatever was destined to happen to happen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
at once. The next moment brought its answer to that
foolish prayer, a whining and whistling of wind that
shook our little shell of a house on its foundations, a
lurid flash or two, and then the tumult of the storm
itself.
</p>
<p>The room where I stood with my children grew suddenly
and uncannily dark. I could hear Struthers
calling thinly from the kitchen door to Whinnie, who
apparently was making a belated effort to get my
chicken-run gate open and my fowls under cover. I
could hear a scattering drive of big rain-drops on the
roof, solemn and soft, like the fall of plump frogs.
But by the time Whinnie was in through the kitchen
door this had changed. It had changed into a passionate
and pulsing beat of rain, whipped and lashed
by the wind that shook the timbers about us. The
air, however, was cooler by this time, and it was easier
to breathe. So I found it hard to understand why
Whinnie, as he stood in the half-light by one of the
windows, should wear such a look of protest on his
morose old face which was the color of a pigskin saddle
just under the stirrup-flap.
</p>
<p>Even when I heard one solitary thump on the roof
over my head, as distinct as the thump of a hammer,
I failed to understand what was worrying my hired
man. Then, after a momentary pause in the rain, the
thumps were repeated. They were repeated in a rattle
which became a clatter and soon grew into one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
continuous stream of sound, like a thousand machine-guns
all going off at once.
</p>
<p>I realized then what it meant, what it was. It was
hail. And it meant that we were being &#8220;hailed out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were being cannonaded with shrapnel from the
skies. We were being deluged with blocks of ice
almost the size of duck-eggs. So thunderous was the
noise that I had no remembrance when the window-panes
on the west side of the house were broken. It
wasn&#8217;t, in fact, until I beheld the wind and water blowing
in through the broken sashes that I awakened to
what had happened. But I did nothing to stop the
flood. I merely sat there with my two babes in my
arms and my Dinkie pressed in close between my
knees, in a foolishly crouching and uncomfortable
position, as though I wanted to shield their tender
little bodies with my own. I remember seeing
Struthers run gabbing and screaming about the room
and then try to bury herself under her mattress, like
the silly old she-ostrich she was, with her number
sevens sticking out from under the bedding. I remember
seeing Whinnie picking up one of the white things
that had rolled in through the broken window. It was
oblong, and about as big as a pullet&#8217;s egg, but more
irregular in shape. It was clear on the outside but
milky at the center, making me think of a half-cooked
globe of tapioca. But it was a stone of solid ice.
And thousands and thousands of stones like that, millions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
of them, were descending on my wheat, were
thrashing down my half-ripened oats, were flailing the
world and beating the life and beauty out of my crops.
</p>
<p>The storm ended almost as abruptly as it had begun.
The hammers of Thor that were trying to pound my
lonely little prairie-house to pieces were withdrawn,
the tumult stopped, and the light grew stronger.
Whinstane Sandy even roused himself and moved
toward the door, which he opened with the hand of a
sleep-walker, and stood staring out. I could see
reflected in that seamed old face the desolation which
for a minute or two I didn&#8217;t have the heart to look
upon. I knew, even before I got slowly up and followed
him toward the door, that our crop was gone,
that we had lost everything.
</p>
<p>I stood in the doorway, staring out at what, only
that morning, had been a world golden with promise,
rich and bountiful and beautiful to the eye and blessed
in the sight of God. And now, at one stroke, it was
all wiped out. As far as the eye could see I beheld
only flattened and shredded ruin. Every acre of my
crop was gone. My year&#8217;s work had been for nothing,
my blind planning, my petty scheming and contriving,
my foolish little hopes and dreams, all, all
were there, beaten down into the mud.
</p>
<p>Yet, oddly enough, it did not stir in me any quick
and angry passion of protest. It merely left me mute
and stunned, staring at it with the eyes of the ox,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
with a dull wonder in my heart and a duller sense of
deprivation away off at the back of my brain. I
scarcely noticed when little Dinkie toddled out and
possessed himself of a number of the larger hailstones,
which he promptly proceeded to suck. When a
smaller one melted in the warmth of his hand, he stared
down at the emptiness between his little brown fingers,
wondering where his pretty pebble had vanished
to, just as I wondered where my crop had gone.
</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s gone. There&#8217;s no doubt of that. The hail
went from southwest to northeast, in a streak about
three miles wide, like a conquering army, licking up
everything as it went. Whinnie says that it&#8217;s the
will of God. Struthers, resurrected from her mattress,
proclaims that it&#8217;s Fate punishing us for our sins.
My head tells me that it&#8217;s barometric laws, operating
along their own ineluctable lines. But that doesn&#8217;t
salve the sore.
</p>
<p>For the rest of the afternoon we stood about like
Italian peasants after an earthquake, possessed of a
sort of collective mutism, doing nothing, saying nothing,
thinking nothing. Even my seven dead pullets,
which had been battered to death by the hail, were left
to lie where they had fallen. I noticed a canvas carrier
for a binder which Whinnie had been mending.
It was riddled like a sieve. If this worried me, it
worried me only vaguely. It wasn&#8217;t until I remembered
that there would be no wheat for that binder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
to cut and no sheaves for that carrier to bear, that
the extent of what had befallen Alabama Ranch once
more came fully home to me. It takes time to digest
such things, just as it takes time to reorganize your
world. The McKails, for the second time, have been
cleaned to the bones. We ought to be getting used to
it, for it&#8217;s the second time we&#8217;ve gone bust in a year!
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until yesterday morning that any kind of
perspective came back to us. I went to bed the night
before wondering about Dinky-Dunk and hoping
against hope that he&#8217;d come galloping over to make
sure his family were still in the land of the living.
But he didn&#8217;t come. And before noon I learned that
Casa Grande had not been touched by the hail. That
at least was a relief, for it meant that Duncan was
safe and sound.
</p>
<p>In a way, yesterday, there was nothing to do, and
yet there was a great deal to do. It reminded me of
the righting up after a funeral. But I refused to
think of anything beyond the immediate tasks in hand.
I just did what had to be done, and went to bed again
dog-tired. But I had nightmare, and woke up in the
middle of the night crying for all I was worth. I
seemed alone in an empty world, a world without meaning
or mercy, and there in the blackness of the night
when the tides of life run lowest, I lay with my hand
pressed against my heart, with the feeling that there
was nothing whatever left in existence to make it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
worth while. Then Pee-Wee stirred and whimpered,
and when I lifted him into my bed and held him
against my breast, the nearness of his body brought
warmth and consolation to mine, and I remembered
that I was still a mother....
</p>
<p>It was this morning (Sunday) that Dinky-Dunk
appeared at Alabama Ranch. I had looked for him
and longed for him, in secret, and my heart should
have leapt up with gladness at the sight of him. But
it didn&#8217;t. It couldn&#8217;t. It was like asking a millstone
to pirouette.
</p>
<p>In the first place, everything seemed wrong. I had
a cold in the head from the sudden drop in the temperature,
and I was arrayed in that drab old gingham
wrapper which Dinkie had cut holes in with
Struthers&#8217; scissors, for I hadn&#8217;t cared much that morning
when I dressed whether I looked like a totem-pole
or a Stoney squaw. And the dregs of what I&#8217;d been
through during the last two days were still sour in
the bottom of my heart. I was a Job in petticoats, a
mutineer against man and God, a nihilist and an
I. W. W. all in one. And Dinky-Dunk appeared in
Lady Alicia&#8217;s car, in <i>her</i> car, carefully togged out in
his Sunday best, with that strangely alien aspect
which citified clothes can give to the rural toiler when
he emerges from the costume of his kind.
</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t merely that he came arrayed in this
outer shell of affluence and prosperity. It was more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
that there was a sense of triumph in his heart which
he couldn&#8217;t possibly conceal. And I wasn&#8217;t slow to
realize what it meant. I was a down-and-outer now,
and at his mercy. He could have his way with me,
without any promise of protest. And whatever he
might have done, or might yet do, it was ordained
that I in my meekness should bow to the yoke. All
that I must remember was that he stood my lord and
master. I had made my foolish little struggle to be
mistress of my own destiny, and now that I had failed,
and failed utterly, I must bend to whatever might be
given to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard luck, Chaddie,&#8221; he said, with a pretense
at being sympathetic. But there was no real sorrow
in his eye as he stood there surveying my devastated
ranch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nix on that King Cophetua stuff!&#8221; I curtly and
vulgarly proclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean?&#8221; he asked, studying my
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly can the condescension stuff!&#8221; I repeated,
taking a wayward satisfaction out of shocking him
with the paraded vulgarity of my phrasing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound like you,&#8221; he said, naturally
surprised, I suppose, that I didn&#8217;t melt into his arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I inquired, noticing that he no longer
cared to meet my eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds hard,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, some man has said that a hard soil makes
a hard race,&#8221; I retorted, with a glance about at my
ruined wheatlands. &#8220;Did you have a pleasant time
in Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked up quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in Chicago,&#8221; he promptly protested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that woman lied, after all,&#8221; I remarked,
with a lump of Scotch granite where my heart ought
to have been. For I could see by his face that he
knew, without hesitation, the woman I meant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an unnecessarily harsh word?&#8221; he asked,
trying, of course, to shield her to the last. And if
he had not exactly winced, he had done the next
thing to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would <i>you</i> call it?&#8221; I countered. It wouldn&#8217;t
have taken a microphone, I suppose, to discover the
hostility in my tone. &#8220;And would it be going too far
to inquire just where you were?&#8221; I continued as I saw
he had no intention of answering my first question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at the Coast,&#8221; he said, compelling himself to
meet my glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I cut your holiday short,&#8221; I
told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was scarcely a holiday,&#8221; he remonstrated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you call it then?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was purely a business trip,&#8221; he retorted.
</p>
<p>There had, I remembered, been a great deal of that
business during the past few months. And an ice-cold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
hand squeezed the last hope of hope out of my
heart. <i>She</i> had been at the Coast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this belated visit to your wife and children, I
presume, is also for business purposes?&#8221; I inquired.
But he was able to smile at that, for all my iciness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> it belated?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you call it that?&#8221; I quietly inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I had to clear up that case of the stolen
horses,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;that Sing Lo thievery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which naturally comes before one&#8217;s family,&#8221; I
ironically reminded him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But courts are courts, Chaddie,&#8221; he maintained,
with a pretense of patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And consideration is consideration,&#8221; I rather
wearily amended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t always do what we want to,&#8221; he
next remarked, apparently intent on being genially
axiomatic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then to what must the humble family attribute
this visit?&#8221; I inquired, despising that tone of mockery
into which I had fallen yet seeming unable to
drag myself out of its muck-bottom depths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To announce that I intend to return to them,&#8221; he
asserted, though it didn&#8217;t seem an easy statement
to make.
</p>
<p>It rather took my breath away, for a moment. But
Reason remained on her throne. It was too much like
sticking spurs into a dead horse. There was too much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
that could not be forgotten. And I calmly reminded
Dinky-Dunk that the lightest of heads can sometimes
have the longest of memories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t want me back?&#8221; he demanded,
apparently embarrassed by my lack of hospitality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It all depends on what you mean by that word,&#8221;
I answered, speaking as judicially as I was able. &#8220;If
by coming back you mean coming back to this house,
I suppose you have a legal right to do so. But if
it means anything more, I&#8217;m afraid it can&#8217;t be done.
You see, Dinky-Dunk, I&#8217;ve got rather used to single
harness again, and I&#8217;ve learned to think and act for
myself, and there&#8217;s a time when continued unfairness
can kill the last little spark of friendliness in any
woman&#8217;s heart. It&#8217;s not merely that I&#8217;m tired of it
all. But I&#8217;m <i>tired of being tired</i>, if you know what
that means. I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m going to do.
Just at present, in fact, I don&#8217;t want to think about it.
But I&#8217;d much prefer being alone until I am able to
straighten things out to my own satisfaction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Dinky-Dunk, looking so crestfallen
that for a moment I in turn felt almost sorry
for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it rather late for that?&#8221; I reminded him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose it is,&#8221; he admitted, with a disturbing
new note of humility. Then he looked up at me,
almost defiantly. &#8220;But you need my help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was masterful man, once more asserting himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
It was a trivial misstep, but a fatal one. It betrayed,
at a flash, his entire misjudgment of me, of my feelings,
of what I was and what I intended to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve rather outlived that period of
Bashi-Bazookism,&#8221; I coolly and quietly explained to
my lord and master. &#8220;You may have the good luck
to be confronting me when I seem to be floored. I&#8217;ve
been hailed out, it&#8217;s true. But that has happened to
other people, and they seem to have survived. And
there are worse calamities, I find, than the loss of
a crop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you referring to anything that I have done?&#8221;
asked Dinky-Dunk, with a slightly belligerent look
in his eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the shoe fits, put it on,&#8221; I observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are certain things I want to explain,&#8221;
he tried to argue, with the look of a man confronted
by an overdraft on his patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has said that a friend,&#8221; I reminded him,
&#8220;is a person to whom one need never explain. And
any necessity for explanation, you see, removes us
even from the realm of friendship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, hang it all, I&#8217;m your husband,&#8221; protested my
obtuse and somewhat indignant interlocutor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We all have our misfortunes,&#8221; I found the heart,
or rather the absence of heart, to remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this isn&#8217;t a very good beginning,&#8221; said
Dinky-Dunk, his dignity more ruffled than ever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a beginning at all,&#8221; I reminded him. &#8220;It&#8217;s
more like an ending.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That kept him silent for quite a long while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you despise me,&#8221; he finally remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely so active an emotion,&#8221; I tried to punish
him by retorting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I at least insist on explaining what took me
to the Coast,&#8221; he contended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is scarcely necessary,&#8221; I told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine the whole country-side does,&#8221; I observed.
</p>
<p>He made a movement of mixed anger and protest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to Vancouver because the government had
agreed to take over my Vancouver Island water-front
for their new shipbuilding yards. If you&#8217;ve forgotten
just what that means, I&#8217;d like to remind you
that there&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t happen to have forgotten,&#8221; I interrupted,
wondering why news which at one time would have
set me on fire could now leave me quite cold. &#8220;But
what caused the government to change its mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allie!&#8221; he said, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, fixing
a slightly combative eye on mine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to have almost unlimited powers,&#8221; I
observed as coolly as I could, making an effort to get
my scattered thoughts into line again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk explained with
quite painful politeness, &#8220;it was merely the accident
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
that she happened to know the naval officer on the
Imperial Board. She was at Banff the week the board
was there, and she was able to put in a good word
for the Vancouver Island site. And the Imperial
verdict swung our own government officials over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were lucky to have such an attractive wirepuller,&#8221;
I frigidly announced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The luck wasn&#8217;t altogether on my side,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk
almost as frigidly retorted, &#8220;when you remember
that it was giving her a chance to get rid of a
ranch she was tired of!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I did my best to hide my surprise, but it wasn&#8217;t
altogether a success. The dimensions of the movement,
apparently, were much greater than my poor
little brain had been able to grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it&#8217;s going to let you take Casa
Grande off her ladyship&#8217;s hands?&#8221; I diffidently inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s already arranged for,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk quite
casually informed me. We were a couple of play-actors,
I felt, each deep in a rôle of his own, each
stirred much deeper than he was ready to admit, and
each a little afraid of the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to be congratulated,&#8221; I told Dinky-Dunk,
chilled in spite of myself, never for a moment quite
able to forget the sinister shadow of Lady Alicia
which lay across our trodden little path of everyday
life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was you and the kiddies I was thinking of,&#8221;
said my husband, in a slightly remote voice. And the
mockery of that statement, knowing what I knew, was
too much for me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you didn&#8217;t think of us a little sooner,&#8221;
I observed. And I had the bitter-sweet reward of
seeing a stricken light creep up into Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t answer that question of his. Instead,
I asked him another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that Lady Alicia came here and
announced that she was in love with you?&#8221; I
demanded, resolved to let the light in to that tangled
mess which was fermenting in the silo of my soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he quietly affirmed, as he hung his
head. &#8220;She told me about it. And it was <i>awful</i>. It
should never have happened. It made me ashamed
even&mdash;even to face you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was natural,&#8221; I agreed, with my heart still
steeled against him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes a fool of a man,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;a situation
like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the right sort of man wouldn&#8217;t encourage
it,&#8221; I reminded him, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t even permit it.&#8221; And
still again I caught that quick movement of impatience
from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that sort of thing to a man of my age?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
he demanded. &#8220;When you get to where I am you
don&#8217;t find love looming so large on the horizon.
What&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it clearly doesn&#8217;t loom so large,&#8221; I interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you want then,&#8221; went on Dinky-Dunk,
ignoring me, &#8220;is power, success, the consolation of
knowing you&#8217;re not a failure in life. <i>That&#8217;s</i> the big
issue, and that&#8217;s the stake men play big for, and play
hard for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, I remembered in my bitterness of soul, what
I myself had been playing hard for&mdash;but I had lost.
And it had left my heart dry. It had left my heart
so dry that my own Dinky-Dunk, standing there
before me in the open sunlight, seemed millions of
miles removed from me, mysteriously depersonalized,
as remote in spirit as a stranger from Mars come to
converse about an inter-stellar telephone-system.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve really achieved your ambition,&#8221; I
reminded my husband, as he stood studying a face
which I tried to keep tranquil under his inspection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he corrected, &#8220;only a small part of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rest?&#8221; I indifferently inquired, wondering
why most of life&#8217;s victories, after all, were
mere Pyrrhic victories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; declared Dinky-Dunk, with a reckless light
in his eyes, &#8220;You, and the children, now that I&#8217;m in
a position to give them what they want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>are</i> you?&#8221; I queried.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m coming back to demonstrate,&#8221;
he found the courage to assert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To them?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To all of you!&#8221; he said with a valiant air of
finality.
</p>
<p>I told him it was useless, but he retorted that he
didn&#8217;t propose to have that stop him. I explained to
him that it would be embarrassing, but he parried
that claim by protesting that sacrifice was good for
the soul. I asserted that it would be a good deal of
a theatricality, under the circumstances, but he
attempted to brush this aside by stating that what he
had endured for years might be repeated by patience.
</p>
<p>So Dinky-Dunk is coming back to Alabama Ranch!
It sounds momentous, and yet, I know in my heart,
that it doesn&#8217;t mean so very much. He will sleep
under the same roof with me as remote as though he
were reposing a thousand miles away. He will breakfast
and go forth to his work, and my thoughts will
not be able to go with him. He will return with the
day&#8217;s weariness in his bones, but a weariness which
I can neither fathom nor explain in my own will keep
my blood from warming at the sound of his voice
through the door. Being still his wife, I shall have
to sew and mend and cook for him. <i>That</i> is the penalty
of prairie life; there is no escape from propinquity.
</p>
<p>But that life can go on in this way, indefinitely, is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
unthinkable. What will happen, I don&#8217;t know. But
there will have to be a change, somewhere. There will
have to be a change, but I am too tired to worry over
what it will be. I&#8217;m too tired even to think of it.
That&#8217;s something which lies in the lap of Time.

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-fifth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk is back. At least he sleeps and breakfasts
at home, but the rest of the time he is over at
Casa Grande getting his crop cut. He&#8217;s too busy, I
fancy, to pay much attention to our mutual lack of
attention. But the compact was made, and he seems
willing to comply with it. The only ones who fail
to regard it are the children. I hadn&#8217;t counted on
them. There are times, accordingly, when they somewhat
complicate the situation. It didn&#8217;t take them
long to get re-acquainted with their daddy. I could
see, from the first, that he intended to be very considerate
and kind with them, for I&#8217;m beginning to
realize that he gets a lot of fun out of the kiddies.
Pee-Wee will go to him, now, from anybody. He
goes with an unmistakable expression of &#8220;Us-men-have-got-to-stick-together&#8221;
satisfaction on his little face.
</p>
<p>But Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s intimacies, I&#8217;m glad to say, do
not extend beyond the children. Three days ago,
though, he asked me about turning his hogs in on my
land. It doesn&#8217;t sound disturbingly emotional. But
if what&#8217;s left of my crop, of course, is any use to
Duncan, he&#8217;s welcome to it....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>I looked for that letter which I wrote to Dinky-Dunk
several weeks ago, looked for it for an hour and
more this morning, but haven&#8217;t succeeded in finding
it. I was sure that I&#8217;d put it between the pages of
the old ranch journal. But it&#8217;s not there.
</p>
<p>Last night before I turned in I read all of Meredith&#8217;s
<i>Modern Love</i>. It was nice to remember that
once, at Box Hill, I&#8217;d felt the living clasp of the hand
which had written that wonderful series of poems.
But never before did I quite understand that elaborated
essay in love-moods. It came like a friendly
voice, like an understanding comrade who knows the
world better than I do, and brought me comfort, even
though the sweetness of it was slightly acidulated,
like a lemon-drop. And as for myself, I suppose I&#8217;ll
continue to

<h2><i>Sunday the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I have written to Uncle Carlton again, asking him
about my Chilean Nitrate shares. If the company&#8217;s
reorganized and the mines opened again, surely my
stock ought to be worth something.
</p>
<p>The days are getting shorter, and the hot weather
is over for good, I hope. I usually like autumn on
the prairie, but the thought of fall, this year, doesn&#8217;t
fill me with any inordinate joy. I&#8217;m unsettled and
atonic, and it&#8217;s just as well, I fancy, that I&#8217;m weaning
the Twins.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the simple operation I&#8217;d expected, but the
worst is already over. Pee-Wee is betraying unmistakable
serpentine powers, and it&#8217;s no longer safe to
leave him on a bed. Poppsy is a fastidious little lady,
and apparently a bit of a philosopher. She is her
father&#8217;s favorite. Whinstane Sandy is loyal to little
Dinkie, and, now that the evenings are longer, regales
him on stories, stories which the little tot can only
half understand. But they must always be about animals,
and Whinnie seems to run to wolves. He&#8217;s told
the story of the skater and the wolves, with personal
embellishments, and Little Red Riding-Hood in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
version all his own, and last night, I noticed, he
recounted the tale of the woman in the sleigh with
her children when the pack of wolves pursued her.
And first, to save herself and her family, she threw
her little baby out to the brutes. And when they had
gained on her once more, she threw out her little girl,
and then her little boy, and then her biggest boy of
ten. And when she reached a settlement and told of
her deliverance, the Oldest Settler took a wood-ax and
clove her head clear down to the shoulder-blades&mdash;the
same, of course, being a punishment for saving
herself at the expense of her little ones.
</p>
<p>My Dinkie sat wriggling his toes with delight, the
tale being of that gruesome nature which appeals to
him. It must have been tried on countless other children,
for, despite Whinnie&#8217;s autobiographical interjections,
the yarn is an old and venerable one, a primitive
Russian folk-tale which even Browning worked
over in his <i>Ivan Ivanovitch</i>.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, wandering in on the tail end of it,
remarked: &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine story, that is, with all those
coyotes singing out there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The chief objection to it,&#8221; I added, &#8220;is that the
lady didn&#8217;t drop her husband over first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk looked down at me as he filled his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the husband, as I remember the story, had
been left behind to do what a mere husband could to
save their home,&#8221; my spouse quietly reminded me.

<h2><i>Monday the Tenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>There was a heavy frost last night. It makes me
feel that summer is over. Dinky-Dunk asked me
yesterday why I disliked Casa Grande and never ventured
over into that neighborhood. I evaded any
answer by announcing that there were very few things
I liked nowadays....
</p>
<p>Only once, lately, have we spoken of Lady Allie.
It was Dinky-Dunk, in fact, who first brought up her
name in speaking of the signing of the transfer-papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true,&#8221; I found the courage to ask, &#8220;that you
knew your cousin quite intimately as a girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk laughed as he tamped down his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it <i>must</i> have been quite intimately,&#8221; he
acknowledged. &#8220;For when she was seven and I was
nine we went all the way down Teignmouth Hill
together in an empty apple-barrel&mdash;than which nothing
that I know of could possibly be more intimate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t join him in his mirth over that incident,
for I happened to remember the look on Lady Alicia&#8217;s
face when she once watched Dinky-Dunk mount his
mustang and ride away. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t men lawds of creation?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
she had dreamily inquired. &#8220;Not after you&#8217;ve
lived with them for a couple of years,&#8221; I had been
heartless enough to retort, just to let her know that
I didn&#8217;t happen to have a skin like a Douglas pine.

<h2><i>Sunday the Sixteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve just had a letter from Uncle Carlton. It&#8217;s a
very long and businesslike letter, in which he goes
into details as to how our company has been incorporated
in <i>La Association de Productores de Salitre
de Chile</i>, with headquarters at Valparaiso. It&#8217;s a new
and rather unexpected arrangement, but he prophesies
that with nitrate at ten shillings per Spanish quintal
the returns on the investment, under the newer conditions,
should be quite satisfactory. He goes on to
explain how nitrate is shipped in bags of one hundred
kilos, and the price includes the bags, but the weight
is taken on the nitrate only, involving a deduction
from the gross weight of seven-tenths per cent.
Then he ambles off into a long discussion of how the
fixation method from the air may eventually threaten
the stability of our entire amalgamated mines, but
probably not during his life-time or even my own.
And I had to read the letter over for the third time
before I winnowed from it the obscure but essential
kernel that my shares from this year forward should
bring me in an annual dividend of at least two thousand,
but more probably three, and possibly even four,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
once the transportation situation is normalized, but
depending largely, of course, on the labor conditions
obtaining in Latin America&mdash;and much more along
the same lines.
</p>
<p>That news of my long-forgotten and long-neglected
nest-egg should have made me happy. But it didn&#8217;t.
I couldn&#8217;t quite react to it. As usual, I thought of
the children first, and from their standpoint it did
bring a sort of relief. It was consoling, of course,
to know that, whatever happened, they could have
woolens on their little tummies and shoe-leather on
their little piggies. But the news didn&#8217;t come with
sufficient force to shock the dull gray emptiness out
of existence. I&#8217;ve even been wondering if there&#8217;s any
news that could. For the one thing that seems always
to face me is the absence of intensity from life. Can
it be, I found myself asking to-day, that it&#8217;s youth,
golden youth, that is slipping away from me?
</p>
<p>It startled me a little, to have to face that question.
But I shake my fist in the teeth of Time. I refuse
to surrender. I shall not allow myself to become antiquated.
I&#8217;m on the wrong track, in some way, but
before I dry up into a winter apple I&#8217;m going to find
out where the trouble is, and correct it. I never was
much of a sleep-walker. I want life, Life&mdash;and
oodles of it....
</p>
<p>Among other things, by the way, which I&#8217;ve been
missing are books. They at least are to be had for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
the buying, and I&#8217;ve decided there&#8217;s no excuse for letting
the channels of my mind get moss-grown. I&#8217;ve
had a &#8220;serious but not fatal wound,&#8221; as the newspapers
say, to my personal vanity, but there&#8217;s no
use in letting go of things, at my time of life. Pee-Wee,
I&#8217;m sure, will never be satisfied with an empty-headed
old frump for a mother, and Dinkie is already
asking questions that are slightly disturbing. Yesterday,
in his bath, he held his hand over his heart. He
held it there for quite a long time, and then he looked
at me with widening eyes. &#8220;Mummy,&#8221; he called out,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a m&#8217;sheen inside me!&#8221; And Whinnie&#8217;s
explorations are surely worth emulating. I too have
a machine inside me which some day I&#8217;ll be compelled
to rediscover. It is a machine which, at present, is
merely a pump, though the ancients, I believe,
regarded it as the seat of the emotions.

<p>Dinky-Dunk is quite subtle. He is ignoring me,
as a modern army of assault ignores a fortress by
simply circling about its forbidding walls and leaving
it in the rear. But I can see that he is deliberately
and patiently making love to my children. He
is entrenching himself in their affection.
</p>
<p>He is, of course, their father, and it is not for me
to interfere. Last night, in fact, when Pee-Wee cried
for his dad, poor old Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s face looked almost
radiumized. He has announced that on Tuesday,
when he will have to go in to Buckhorn, he intends to
carry along the three kiddies and have their photograph
taken. It reminded me that I had no picture
whatever of the Twins. And that reminded me, in
turn, of what a difference there is between your first
child and the tots who come later. Little Dinkie,
being a novelty, was followed by a phosphorescent
wake of diaries and snap-shots and weigh-scales and
growth-records, with his birthdays duly reckoned, not
by the year, but by the month.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I love the Twins less. It&#8217;s only that
the novelty has passed. And in one way it&#8217;s a good
thing, for over your second and third baby you worry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
less. You know what is needed, and how to do it.
You blaze your trail, as a mother, with your first-born.
You build your road, and after that you are no longer
a pioneer. You know the way you have to go, henceforth,
and you follow it. It is less a Great Adventure,
perhaps, but, on the other hand, the double-pointed
tooth of Anxiety does not rowel quite so often
at the core of your heart.... I&#8217;ve been wondering
if, with the coming of the children, there is not
something which slips away from the relationship
between husband and wife. That there is a difference
is not to be denied. There was a time when I resented
this and tried to fight against it. But I wasn&#8217;t big
enough, I suppose, to block the course of Nature.
And it <i>was</i> Nature, you have to admit when you come
to look it honestly in the face, Nature in her inexorable
economy working out her inexorable ends. If I
hadn&#8217;t loved Dinky-Dunk, fondly, foolishly, abandonedly,
there would have been no little Dinkie and
Poppsy and Pee-Wee. They would have been left
to wander like disconsolate little ghosts through that
lonely and twilit No-Man&#8217;s Land of barren love and
unwanted babes. And the only thing that keeps me
human, nowadays, that keeps me from being a woman
with a dead soul, a she-being of untenanted hide and
bones and dehydrated ham-strings, is my kiddies. The
thought of them, at any time of the day, can put a
cedilla under my heart to soften it....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>Struthers, who is to go in to Buckhorn with the
children when they have their picture taken, is already
deep in elaborating preparations for that expedition.
She is improvising an English nurse&#8217;s uniform and
has asked if there might be one picture of her and
the children.

<h2><i>Tuesday the Fifteenth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The children have been away for a whole day, the
first time in family history. And oh, what a difference
it makes in this lonely little prairie home of ours!
The quietness, the emptiness, the desolation of it all
was something quite beyond my imagination. I know
now that I could never live apart from them. Whatever
happens, I shall not be separated from my
kiddies....
</p>
<p>I spent my idle time in getting Peter&#8217;s music-box
in working order. Dinky-Dunk, who despises it,
thoughtlessly sat on the package of records and broke
three of them. I&#8217;ve been trying over the others. They
sound tinny and flat, and I&#8217;m beginning to suspect I
haven&#8217;t my sound-box adjusted right. I&#8217;ve a hunger
to hear good music. And without quite knowing it,
I&#8217;ve been craving for city life again, for at least a
taste of it, for even a chocolate cream-soda at a Huyler
counter. Dinky-Dunk yesterday said that I was a
cloudy creature, and accused me of having a mutinous
mouth. Men seem to think that love should be like
an eight-day clock, with a moment or two of industrious
winding-up rewarded by a long week of undeviating
devotion.

</div>

<p>The thrashing outfits are over at Casa Grande, and
my being a mere spectator of the big and busy final
act of the season&#8217;s drama reminds me of three years
ago, just before Dinkie arrived. Struthers, however,
is at Casa Grande and in her glory, the one and only
woman in a circle of nine active-bodied men.
</p>
<p>I begin to see that it&#8217;s true what Dinky-Dunk said
about business looming bigger in men&#8217;s lives than
women are apt to remember. He&#8217;s working hard, and
his neck&#8217;s so thin that his Adam&#8217;s apple sticks out
like a push-button, but he gets his reward in finding
his crop running much higher than he had figured.
He&#8217;s as keen as ever he was for power and prosperity.
He wants success, and night and day he&#8217;s scheming
for it. Sometimes I wonder if he didn&#8217;t deliberately
<i>use</i> his cousin Allie in this juggling back of Casa
Grande into his own hands. Yet Dinky-Dunk, with
all his faults, is not, and could not be, circuitous. I
feel sure of that.
</p>
<p>He became philosophical, the other day when I complained
about the howling of the coyotes, and protested
it was these horizon-singers that kept the prairie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
clean. He even argued that the flies which seem
such a pest to the cattle in summer-time are a blessing
in disguise, since the unmolested animals over-eat when
feed is plentiful and get black-rot. So out of suffering
comes wisdom and out of endurance comes fortitude!

<h2><i>Thursday the Sixth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>On Tuesday morning we had our first snow of the
season, or, rather, before the season. It wasn&#8217;t much
of a snow-storm, but Dinkie was greatly worked up
at the sight of it and I finally put on his little reefer
and his waders and let him go out in it. But the
weather had moderated, the snow turned to slush, and
when I rescued Dinkie from rolling in what looked to
him like a world of ice-cream he was a very wet boy.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday night Dinkie, usually so sturdy and
strong, woke up with a tight little chest-cough that
rather frightened me. I went over to his crib and
covered him up. But when he wakened me again, a
couple of hours later, the cough had grown tighter.
It turned into a sort of sharp bark. And this time
I found Dinkie hot and feverish. So I got busy, rubbing
his chest with sweet oil and turpentine until the
skin was pink and giving him a sip or two of cherry
pectoral which I still had on the upper shelf of the
cupboard.
</p>
<p>When morning came he was no better. He seemed
in a stupor, rousing only to bark into his pillow. I
called Dinky-Dunk in, before he left in the pouring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
rain for Casa Grande, and he said, almost indifferently,
&#8220;Yes, the boy&#8217;s got a cold all right.&#8221; But
that was all.
</p>
<p>When breakfast was over I tried Dinkie with hot
gruel, but he declined it. He refused to eat, in fact,
and remembering what Peter had once said about my
first-born being pantophagous, I began to suspect
that I had a very sick boy on my hands.
</p>
<p>At noon, when he seemed no better, I made a mild
mustard-plaster and put it on the upper part of his
little chest. I let it burn there until he began to cry
with the discomfort of it. Then I tucked a double fold
of soft flannel above his thorax.
</p>
<p>As night came on he was more flushed and feverish
than ever, and I wished to heaven that I&#8217;d a clinic
thermometer in the house. For by this time I was
more than worried: I was panicky. Yet Duncan, when
he came in, and got out of his oil-skins, didn&#8217;t seem
very sympathetic. He flatly refused to share my
fears. The child, he acknowledged, had a croupy little
chest-cold, but all he wanted was keeping warm and
as much water as he could drink. Nature, he largely
protested, would attend to a case like that.
</p>
<p>I was ready to turn on him like a she-tiger, but I
held myself in, though it took an effort. I saw
Duncan go off to bed, dog-tired, of course, but I felt
that to go to sleep, under the circumstances, would
be criminal. Dinkie, in the meantime, was waking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
every now and then and barking like a baby-coyote.
I could have stood it, I suppose, if that old Bobs of
ours hadn&#8217;t started howling outside, in long-drawn
and dreary howls of unutterable woe. I remembered
about a dog always howling that way when somebody
was going to die in the house. And I concluded, with
an icy heart, that it was the death-howl. I tried to
count Dinkie&#8217;s pulse, but it was so rapid and I was so
nervous that I lost track of the beats. So I decided to
call Dinky-Dunk.
</p>
<p>He came in to us kind of sleepy-eyed and with his
hair rumpled up, and asked, without thinking, what
I wanted.
</p>
<p>And I told him, with a somewhat shaky voice, what
I wanted. I said I wanted antiphlogistine, and a
pneumonia-jacket, and a doctor, and a trained nurse,
and just a few of the comforts of civilization.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, staring at me as though I were a madwoman,
went over to Dinkie&#8217;s crib, and felt his forehead
and the back of his neck, and held an ear against
the boy&#8217;s chest, and then against his shoulder-blades.
He said it was all right, and that I myself ought to
be in bed. As though in answer to that Dinkie barked
out his croupy protest, tight and hard, barked as I&#8217;d
never heard a child bark before. And I began to fuss,
for it tore my heart to think of that little body burning
up with fever and being denied its breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might just as well get back to bed,&#8221; repeated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
Dinky-Dunk, rather impatiently. And that was the
spark which set off the mine, which pushed me clear
over the edge of reason. I&#8217;d held myself in for so
long, during weeks and weeks of placid-eyed self-repression,
that when the explosion did come I went
off like a Big Bertha. I turned on my husband with
a red light dancing before my face and told him he
was a beast and a heartless brute. He tried to stop
me, but it was no use. I even said that this was a hell
of a country, where a white woman had to live like
a Cree squaw and a child had to die like a sick hound
in a coulée. And I said a number of other things,
which must have cut to the raw, for even in the uncertain
lamplight I could see that Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s face
had become a kind of lemon-color, which is the nearest
to white a sunburned man seems able to turn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get a doctor, if you want one,&#8221; he said, with
an over-tried-patience look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t want a doctor,&#8221; I told him, a little shrill-voiced
with indignation. &#8220;It&#8217;s the child who wants
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get your doctor,&#8221; he repeated as he began
dressing, none too quickly. And it took him an interminable
time to get off, for it was raining cats and
dogs, a cold, sleety rain from the northeast, and the
shafts had to be taken off the buckboard and a pole
put in, for it would require a team to haul anything
on wheels to Buckhorn, on such a night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>It occurred to me, as I stood at the window and saw
Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s lantern wavering about in the rain
while he was getting the team and hooking them on
to the buckboard, that it would be only the decent
thing to send him off with a cup of hot coffee, now
that I had the kettle boiling. But he&#8217;d martyrize
himself, I knew, by refusing it, even though I made it.
And he was already sufficiently warmed by the fires
of martyrdom.
</p>
<p>Yet it was an awful night, I realized when I stood
in the open door and stared after him as he swung
out into the muddy trail with the stable lantern lashed
to one end of his dashboard. And I felt sorry, and a
little guilty, about the neglected cup of coffee.
</p>
<p>I went back to little Dinkie, and found him asleep.
So I sat down beside him. I sat there wrapped up in
one of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s four-point Hudson-Bays, deciding
that if the child&#8217;s cough grew tighter I&#8217;d rig up
a croup-tent, as I&#8217;d once seen Chinkie&#8217;s doctor do with
little Gimlets. But Dinkie failed to waken. And I
fell asleep myself, and didn&#8217;t open an eye until I half-tumbled
out of the chair, well on toward morning.
</p>
<p>By the time Dinky-Dunk got back with the doctor,
who most unmistakably smelt of Scotch whisky, I had
breakfast over and the house in order and the Twins
fed and bathed and off for their morning nap. I had
a fresh nightie on little Dinkie, who rather upset me
by announcing that he wanted to get up and play with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
his Noah&#8217;s Ark, for his fever seemed to have slipped
away from him and the tightness had gone from his
cough. But I said nothing as that red-faced and
sweet-scented doctor looked the child over. His stethoscope,
apparently, tickled Dinkie&#8217;s ribs, for after trying
to wriggle away a couple of times he laughed out
loud. The doctor also laughed. But Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
eye happened to meet mine.
</p>
<p>It would be hard to describe his expression. All
I know is that it brought a disagreeable little sense
of shame to my hypocritical old heart, though I
wouldn&#8217;t have acknowledged it, for worlds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, those lungs are clear,&#8221; I heard the man of
medicine saying to my husband. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a nasty
little cold, of course, but nothing to worry over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His optimism struck me as being rather unprofessional,
for if you travel half a night to a case, it
seems to me, it ought not to be brushed aside with a
laugh. And I was rather sorry that I had such a
good breakfast waiting for them. Duncan, it&#8217;s true,
did not eat a great deal, but the way that red-faced
doctor lapped up my coffee with clotted cream and
devoured bacon and eggs and hot muffins should have
disturbed any man with an elementary knowledge of
dietetics. And by noon Dinkie was pretty much his
old self again. I half expected that Duncan would
rub it in a little. But he has remained discreetly
silent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>Next time, of course, I&#8217;ll have a better idea of what
to do. But I&#8217;ve been thinking that this exquisite and
beautiful animalism known as the maternal instinct
can sometimes emerge from its exquisiteness. Children
are a joy and a glory, but you pay for that joy
and glory when you see them stretched out on a bed
of pain, with the shadow of Death hovering over them.
</p>
<p>When I tried to express something like this to
Dunkie last night, somewhat apologetically, he looked
at me with an odd light in his somber old Scotch
Canadian eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you see him really ill,&#8221; he remarked,
man-like, stubbornly intent on justifying himself.
But I was too busy saying a little prayer, demanding
of Heaven that such a day might never come, to
bother about delivering myself of the many laboriously
concocted truths which I&#8217;d assembled for my
bone-headed lord and master. I was grateful enough
for things as they were, and I could afford to be
generous.

<h2><i>Sunday the Ninth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>For the first time since I came out on the prairie,
I dread the thought of winter. Yet it&#8217;s really something
more than the winter I dread, since snow and
cold have no terrors for me. I need only to look back
about ten short months and think of those crystal-clear
winter days of ours, with the sleigh piled up
with its warm bear-robes, the low sun on the endless
sea of white, the air like champagne, the spanking
team frosted with their own breath, the caroling
sleigh-bells, and the man who still meant so much to
me at my side. Then the homeward drive at night,
under violet clear skies, over drifts of diamond-dust,
to the warmth and peace and coziness of one&#8217;s own
hearth! It was often razor-edge weather, away below
zero, but we had furs enough to defy any threat of
frost-nip.
</p>
<p>We still have the furs, it&#8217;s true, but there&#8217;s the
promise of a different kind of frost in the air now, a
black frost that creeps into the heart which no furs
can keep warm....
</p>
<p>We still have the furs, as I&#8217;ve already said, and
I&#8217;ve been looking them over. They&#8217;re so plentiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
in this country that I&#8217;ve rather lost my respect
for them. Back in the old days I used to invade
those mirrored and carpeted <i>salons</i> where a trained
and deferential saleswoman would slip sleazy and
satin-lined moleskin coats over my arms and adjust
baby-bear and otter and ermine and Hudson-seal
next to my skin. It always gave me a very
luxurious and Empressy sort of feeling to see
myself arrayed, if only experimentally, in silver-fox
and plucked beaver and fisher, to feel the soft
pelts and observe how well one&#8217;s skin looked above
seal-brown or shaggy bear.
</p>
<p>But I never knew what it cost. I never even considered
where they came from, or what they grew on,
and it was to me merely a vague and unconfirmed
legend that they were all torn from the carcasses of
far-away animals. Prairie life has brought me a little
closer to that legend, and now that I know what I
do, it makes a difference.
</p>
<p>For with the coming of the cold weather, last winter,
Francois and Whinstane Sandy took to trapping,
to fill in the farm-work hiatus. They made it a campaign,
and prepared for it carefully, concocting
stretching-rings and cutting-boards and fashioning
rabbit-snares and overhauling wicked-looking iron
traps, which were quite ugly enough even before they
became stained and clotted and rusted with blood.
</p>
<p>They had a very successful season, but even at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
first it struck me as odd to see two men, not outwardly
debased, so soberly intent on their game of killing.
And in the end I got sick of the big blood-rusted traps
and the stretching-rings and the blood-smeared cutting-boards
and the smell of pelts being cured. For
every pelt, I began to see, meant pain and death. In
one trap Francois found only the foot of a young
red fox: it had gnawed its leg off to gain freedom
from those vicious iron jaws that had bitten so suddenly
into its flesh and bone and sinew. He also told
me of finding a young bear which had broken the
anchor-chain of a twelve-pound trap and dragged it
over one hundred miles. All the fight, naturally, was
gone out of the little creature. It was whimpering
like a woman when Francois came up with it&mdash;poor
little tortured broken-hearted thing! And some
empty-headed heiress goes mincing into the Metropolitan,
on a Caruso night, very proud and peacocky
over her new ermine coat, without ever dreaming it&#8217;s a
patchwork of animal sufferings that is keeping her
fat body warm, and that she&#8217;s trying to make herself
beautiful in a hundred tragedies of the wild.
</p>
<p>If women only thought of these things! But we
women have a very convenient hand-made imagination
all our own, and what upsets us as perfect ladies we
graciously avoid. Yet if the petticoated Vandal in
that ermine coat were compelled to behold from her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
box-chair in the Metropolitan, not a musty old love-affair
set to music, but the spectacle of how each little
animal whose skin she has appropriated had been made
to suffer, the hours and sometimes days of torture it
had endured, and how, if still alive when the trapper
made the rounds of his sets, it had been carefully
strangled to death by that frugal harvester, to the
end that the pelt might not be bloodied and reckoned
only as a &#8220;second&#8221;&mdash;if the weasel-decked lady, I
repeat, had to witness all this with her own beaded
eyes, our wilderness would not be growing into quite
such a lonely wilderness.
</p>
<p>Or some day, let&#8217;s put it, as one of these beaver-clad
ladies tripped through the Ramble in Central
Park, supposing a steel-toothed trap suddenly and
quite unexpectedly snapped shut on her silk-stockinged
ankle and she writhed and moaned there in
public, over the week-end. Then possibly her cries
of suffering might make her sisters see a little more
light. But the beaver, they tell me, is trapped under
the ice, always in running water. A mud-ball is placed
a little above the waiting trap, to leave the water
opaque, and when the angry iron jaws have snapped
shut on their victim, that victim drowns, a prisoner.
Francois used to contend shruggingly that it was an
easy death. It may be easy compared with some of
the other deaths imposed on his furry captives. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
it&#8217;s not my idea of bliss, drowning under a foot or two
of ice with a steel trap mangling your ankle for full
measure!
</p>
<p>&#8220;We live forward, but we understand backward.&#8221;
I don&#8217;t know who first said it. But the older I grow
the more I realize how true it is.

</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve written to Peter, reminding him of his promise,
and asking about the Pasadena bungalow.
</p>
<p>It seems the one way out. I&#8217;m tired of living like
an Alpine ibex, all day long above the snow-line. I&#8217;m
tired of this blind alley of inaction. I&#8217;m tired of
decisions deferred and threats evaded. I want to get
away to think things over, to step back and regain a
perspective on the over-smudged canvas of life.
</p>
<p>To remain at Alabama Ranch during the winter can
mean only a winter of discontent and drifting&mdash;and
drifting closer and closer to uncharted rocky ledges.
There&#8217;s no ease for the mouth where one tooth aches,
as the Chinese say.
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, I think, has an inkling of how I feel.
He is very thoughtful and kind in small things, and
sometimes looks at me with the eyes of a boy&#8217;s dog
which has been forbidden to follow the village gang
a-field. And it&#8217;s not that I dislike him, or that he
grates on me, or that I&#8217;m not thankful enough for
the thousand and one little kind things he does. But
it&#8217;s rubbing on the wrong side of the glass. It can&#8217;t
bring back the past. My husband of to-day is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
the Dinky-Dunk I once knew and loved and laughed
with. To go back to dogs, it reminds me of Chinkie&#8217;s
St. Bernard, &#8220;Father Tom,&#8221; whom Chinkie petted and
trained and loved almost to adoration. And when poor
old Father Tom was killed Chinkie in his madness
insisted that a taxidermist should stuff and mount that
dead dog, which stood, thereafter, not a quick and living
companion but a rather gruesome monument of a
vanished friendship. It was, of course, the shape and
color of the thing he had once loved; but you can&#8217;t
feed a hungry heart by staring at a pair of glass eyes
and a wired tail without any wag in it.

<p>Struthers and I have been busy making clothes,
during the absence of Dinky-Dunk, who has been off
duck-shooting for the last three days. He complained
of being a bit tuckered out and having stood the gaff
too long and needing a change. The outing will do
him good. The children miss him, of course, but he&#8217;s
promised to bring Dinkie home an Indian bow-and-arrow.
I can see death and destruction hanging
over the glassware of this household.... The
weather has been stormy, and yesterday Whinnie and
Struthers put up the stove in the bunk-house. They
were a long time about it, but I was reluctant to stop
the flutterings of Cupid&#8217;s wings.

<p>I had a brief message from Peter stating the Pasadena
house is entirely at my disposal.... Dinky-Dunk
came back with a real pot-hunter&#8217;s harvest of
wild ducks, which we&#8217;ll pick and dress and freeze for
winter use. I&#8217;m taking the breast-feathers for my
pillows and Whinstane Sandy is taking what&#8217;s left
for a sleeping-bag&mdash;from which I am led to infer
that he&#8217;s still reconciled to a winter of solitude.
Struthers, I know, could tell him of a warmer bag than
that, lined with downier feathers from the pinions of
Eros. But, as I&#8217;ve said before, Fate, being blind,
weaves badly.

<p>I&#8217;ve just told Dinky-Dunk of my decision to take
the kiddies to California for the winter months. He
rather surprised me by agreeing with everything I
suggested. He feels, I think, as I do, that there&#8217;s
danger in going aimlessly on and on as we have been
doing. And it&#8217;s really a commonplace for the prairie
rancher&mdash;when he can afford it&mdash;to slip down to California
for the winter. They go by the thousand, by
the train-load.

<h2><i>Friday the Sixth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s three long weeks since I&#8217;ve had time for either
ink or retrospect. But at last I&#8217;m settled, though I
feel as though I&#8217;d died and ascended into Heaven, or
at least changed my world, as the Chinks say, so different
is Pasadena to the prairie and Alabama Ranch.
For as I sit here on the <i>loggia</i> of Peter&#8217;s house I&#8217;m
bathed in a soft breeze that is heavy with a fragrance
of flowers, the air is the air of our balmiest midsummer,
and in a pepper-tree not thirty feet away a
mocking-bird is singing for all it&#8217;s worth. It seems
a poignantly beautiful world. And everything suggests
peace. But it was not an easy peace to attain.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the trip down was rather a nightmare.
It brought home to me the fact that I had three
young barbarians to break and subjugate, three untrained
young outlaws who went wild with their first
plunge into train-travel and united in defiance of
Struthers and her foolishly impressive English uniform
which always makes me think of Regent Park.
I have a suspicion that Dinky-Dunk all the while knew
of the time I&#8217;d have, but sagely held his peace.
</p>
<p>I had intended, when I left home, to take the boat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
at Victoria and go down to San Pedro, for I was
hungry for salt water and the feel of a rolling deck
under my feet again. But the antics of my three
little outlaws persuaded me, before we pulled into Calgary,
that it would be as well to make the trip south
as short a one as possible. Dinkie disgraced me in the
dining-car by insisting on &#8220;drinking&#8221; his mashed
potatoes, and made daily and not always ineffectual
efforts to appropriate all the fruit on the table, and
on the last day, when I&#8217;d sagaciously handed him over
to the tender mercies of Struthers, I overheard this
dialogue:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want shooder in my soup!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But little boys don&#8217;t eat sugar in their soup.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want shooder in my soup!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, darling, mommie doesn&#8217;t eat sugar in her
soup!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shooder! Dinkie wants shooder, shooder in his
soup!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy never eats shooder in his soup, Sweetness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want shooder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But really nice little boys don&#8217;t ask for sugar in
their soup,&#8221; argued the patient-eyed Struthers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Shooder!</i>&#8221; insisted the implacable tyrant. And he
got it.
</p>
<p>There was an exceptional number of babies and
small children on board and my unfraternal little
prairie-waifs did not see why every rattle and doll and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
automatic toy of their little fellow travelers and sister
tourists shouldn&#8217;t promptly become their own private
property. And traveling with twins not yet a
year old is scarcely conducive to rest.
</p>
<p>And yet, for all the worry and tumult, I found a
new peace creeping into my soul. It was the first sight
of the Rockies, I think, which brought the change.
I&#8217;d grown tired of living on a billiard-table, without
quite knowing it, tired of the trimly circumscribed
monotony of material life, of the isolating flat contention
against hunger and want. But the mountains
took me out of myself. They were Peter&#8217;s windmill,
raised to the Nth power. They loomed above me,
seeming to say: &#8220;We are timeless. You, puny one, can
live but a day.&#8221; They stood there as they had stood
from the moment God first whispered: &#8220;Let there be
light&#8221;&mdash;and there was light. But no, I&#8217;m wrong
there, as Peter would very promptly have told me, for
it was only in the Cambrian Period that the cornerstone
of the Rockies was laid. The geologic clock
ticked out its centuries until the swamps of the Coal
Period were full of Peter&#8217;s Oldest Inhabitants in the
form of Dinosaurs and then came the Cretaceous Period
and the Great Architect looked down and bade
the Rockies arise, and tooled them into beauty with
His blue-green glaciers and His singing rivers, and
touched the lordliest peaks with wine-glow and filled
the azure valleys with music and peace. And we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
threaded along those valley-sides on our little ribbons
of steel, skirted the shouting rivers and plunged into
tiny twisted tubes of darkness, emerging again into
the light and once more hearing the timeless giants,
with their snow-white heads against the sunset, repeat
their whisper: &#8220;We live and are eternal. Ye, who fret
about our feet, dream for a day, and are forgotten!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But we seemed to be stepping out into a new world,
by the time we got to Pasadena. It was a summery
and flowery and holiday world, and it impressed me as
being solely and scrupulously organized for pleasure.
Yet all minor surprises were submerged in the biggest
surprise of Peter&#8217;s bungalow, which is really more
like a <i>château</i>, and strikes me as being singularly like
Peter himself, not amazingly impressive to look at,
perhaps, but hiding from the world a startingly rich
and luxurious interior. The house itself, half hidden
in shrubbery, is of weather-stained stucco, and looks
at first sight a little gloomy, with the <i>patina</i> of time
upon it. But it is a restful change from the spick-and-spanness
of the near-by millionaire colony, so eloquent
of the paint-brush and the lawn-valet&#8217;s shears,
so smug and new and strident in its paraded opulence.
Peter&#8217;s gardens, in fact, are a rather careless riot of
color and line, a sort of achieved genteel roughness,
like certain phases of his house, as though the wave of
refinement driven too high had broken and tumbled
over on itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>The house, which is the shape of an &#8220;E&#8221; without
the middle stroke, has a green-sodded <i>patio</i> between
the two wings, with a small fountain and a stained
marble basin at the center. There are shade-trees and
date-palms and shrubs and Romanesque-looking stone
seats about narrow walks, for this is the only really
formalized portion of the entire property. This leads
off into a grove and garden, a confusion of flowers and
trees where I&#8217;ve already been able to spot out a number
of orange trees, some of them well fruited, several
lemon and fig trees, a row of banana trees, or plants,
whichever they should be called, besides pepper and
palm and acacia and a long-legged double-file of eucalyptus
at the rear. And in between is a pergola and
a mixture of mimosa and wistaria and tamarisk and
poppies and trellised roses and one woody old geranium
with a stalk like a crab-apple trunk and growth
enough to cover half a dozen prairie hay-stacks.
</p>
<p>But, as I&#8217;ve already implied, it was the inside of
the house that astonished me. It is much bigger than
it looks and is crowded with the most gorgeous old
things in copper and brass and leather and mahogany
that I ever saw under one roof. It has three open
fireplaces, a huge one of stone in the huge living-room,
and rough-beamed ceilings of redwood, and Spanish
tiled floors, and chairs upholstered with cowhide with
the ranch-brand still showing in the tanned leather,
and tables of Mexican mahogany set in redwood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
frames, and several convenient little electric heaters
which can be carried from room to room as they are
needed.
</p>
<p>Pinshaw, Peter&#8217;s gardener and care-taker, had
before our arrival picked several clumps of violets,
with perfume like the English violets, and the house
was aired and everything waiting and ready when we
came, even to two bottles of certified milk in the icebox
for the babies and half a dozen Casaba melons for
their elders. My one disturbing thought is that it
will be a hard house to live up to. But Struthers,
who is not untouched with her <i>folie de grandeur</i>, has
the slightly flurried satisfaction of an exile who has at
last come into her own. One of the first things I
must do, however, is to teach my kiddies to respect
Peter&#8217;s belongings. In one cabinet of books, which
is locked, I have noticed several which are by &#8220;Peter
Ketley&#8221; himself. Yet that name meant nothing to me,
when I met it out on the prairie and humiliated its
owner by converting him into one of my hired hands.
<i>Ce monde est plein de fous.</i>

<p>This is a great climate for meditation. And I have
been meditating. Back at Alabama Ranch, I suppose,
there&#8217;s twenty degrees of frost and a northwest wind
like a search-warrant. Here there&#8217;s a pellucid blue
sky, just enough breeze to rustle the bamboo-fronds
behind me, and a tall girl in white lawn, holding a pale
green parasol over her head and meandering slowly
along the sun-steeped boulevard, which smells of
hot tar.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting here staring down that boulevard,
with the strong light making me squint a little. I&#8217;ve
been watching the two rows of date-palms along the
curb, with their willow-plume head-dress stirring lazily
in the morning breeze. Well back from the smooth
and shining asphalt, as polished as ebony with its oil-drip
and tire-wear, is a row of houses, some shingled
and awninged, some Colonial-Spanish, and stuccoed
and bone-white in the sun, some dark-wooded and vine-draped
and rose-grown, but all immaculate and finished
and opulent. The street is very quiet, but half-way
down the block I can see a Jap gardener in brown
denim sedately watering a well-barbered terrace. Still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
farther away, somebody, in one of the deep-shadowed
porches, is tinkling a ukelele, and somebody that I
can&#8217;t see is somewhere beating a rug. I can see a little
rivulet of water that flows sparkling down the
asphalted runnel of the curb. Then the clump of
bamboos back by Peter&#8217;s bedroom window rustles
crisply again and is quiet and the silence is broken by
a nurse-maid calling to a child sitting in a toy motor-wagon.
Then a touring-car purrs past, with the sun
flashing on its polished metal equipment, and the toy
motor child being led reluctantly homeward by the
maid cries shrilly, and in the silence that ensues I can
hear the faint hiss of a spray-nozzle that builds a
transient small rainbow just beyond the trellis of
Cherokee roses from which a languid white petal falls,
from time to time.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <i>dolce-far-niente</i> day, as all the days seem to
be here, and the best that I can do is sit and brood like
a Plymouth Rock with a full crop. But I&#8217;ve been
thinking things over. And I&#8217;ve come to several conclusions.
</p>
<p>One is that I&#8217;m not so contented as I thought I was
going to be. I am oppressed by a shadowy feeling of
in some way sailing under false colors. I am also
hounded by an equally shadowy impression that I&#8217;m
a convalescent. Yet I find myself vulgarly healthy,
my kiddies have all acquired a fine coat of tan, and
only Struthers is slightly off her feed, having acquired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
a not unmerited attack of cholera morbus from over-indulgence
in Casaba melon. But I keep wondering if
Dinky-Dunk is getting the right sort of things to eat,
if he&#8217;s lonely, and what he does in his spare time.
</p>
<p>And another conclusion I&#8217;ve come to is that men,
much as I hate to admit it, are built of a stronger
fiber than women. They seem able to stand shock
better than the weaker sex. They are not so apt to
go down under defeat, to take the full count, as I
have done. For I still have to face the fact that I
was a failure. Then I turned tail and fled from the
scene of my collapse. That flight, it is true, has
brought me a certain brand of peace, but it is not an
enduring peace, for you can&#8217;t run away from what&#8217;s
in your own heart. And already I&#8217;m restless and ill-at-ease.
It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;m dissatisfied; it&#8217;s
more that I&#8217;m unsatisfied. There still seems to be
something momentous left out of the plan of things.
I have the teasing feeling of confronting something
which is still impending, which is being withheld,
which I can not reach out for, no matter how I try,
until the time is ripe.... Those rustling bamboos
so close to the room where I sleep have begun
to bother me so much that I&#8217;m migrating to a new
bedroom to-night. &#8220;There&#8217;s never anything without
something!&#8221;

<p>Little Dinky-Dunk has adventured into illicit
knowledge of his first orange from the bough. It was
one of Peter&#8217;s low-hanging Valencias, and seems to
have left no ill-effects, though I prefer that all inside
matter be carefully edited before consumption by that
small Red. So Struthers hereafter must stand the
angel with the flaming sword and guard the gates that
open upon that tree of forbidden fruit. Her own
colic, by the way, is a thing of the past, and at present
she&#8217;s extremely interested in Pinshaw, who, she
tells me, was once a cabinet-maker in England, and
came out to California for his health. Struthers, as
usual, is attempting to reach the heart of her new victim
by way of the stomach, and Pinshaw, apparently,
is not unappreciative, since he appears a little more
punctually at his watering and raking and gardening
and has his ears up like a rabbit for the first inkling
of his lady-love&#8217;s matutinal hand-out. And poor old
Whinstane Sandy, back at Alabama Ranch, is still
making sheep&#8217;s eyes at the patches which Struthers
once sewed on his breeks, like as not, and staring with
a moonish smile at the atrabilious photograph which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
the one camera-artist of Buckhorn made of Struthers
and my three pop-eyed kiddies....
</p>
<p>These are, without exception, the friendliest people
I have ever known. The old millionaire lumberman
from Bay City, who lives next door to me, pushes
through the hedge with platefuls of green figs and
tid-bits from his gardens, and delightful girls whose
names I don&#8217;t even know come in big cars and ask to
take little Dinkie off for one of their lawn <i>fêtes</i>. It
even happened that a movie-actor&mdash;who, I later discovered,
was a drug-addict&mdash;insisted on accompanying
me home and informed me on the way that I had
a dream of a face for camera-work. It quite set me
up, for all its impertinence, until I learned to my sorrow
that it had flowered out of nothing more than an
extra shot in the arm.
</p>
<p>They are a friendly and companionable folk, and
they&#8217;d keep me on the go all the time if I&#8217;d let &#8217;em.
But I&#8217;ve only had energy enough to run over to Los
Angeles twice, though there are a dozen or two people
I must look up in that more frolicsome suburb. But
I can&#8217;t get away from the feeling, the truly rural feeling,
that I&#8217;m among strangers. I can&#8217;t rid myself of
the extremely parochial impression that these people
are not my people. And there&#8217;s a valetudinarian
aspect to the place which I find slightly depressing.
For this seems to be the one particular point where
the worn-out old money-maker comes to die, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
antique ladies with asthma struggle for an extra year
or two of the veranda rocking-chair, and rickety old
<i>beaux</i> sit about in Panamas and white flannels and
listen to the hardening of their arteries. And I
haven&#8217;t quite finished with life yet&mdash;not if I know it&mdash;not
by a long shot!
</p>
<p>But one has to be educated for idleness, I find,
almost as much as for industry. I knew the trick
once, but I&#8217;ve lost the hang of it. The one thing that
impresses me, on coming straight from prairie life
to a city like this, is how much women-folk can have
done for them without quite knowing it. The machinery
of life here is so intricate and yet so adequate that
it denudes them of all the normal and primitive activities
of their grandmothers, so they have to invent
troubles and contrive quite unnecessary activities to
keep from being bored to extinction. Everything
seems to come to them ready-made and duly prepared,
their bread, their light and fuel and water, their
meat and milk. All that, and the daily drudgery it
implies, is made ready and performed beyond their
vision, and they have no balky pumps to prime and no
fires to build, and they&#8217;d probably be quite disturbed
to think that their roasts came from a slaughter-house
with bloody floors and that their breakfast rolls, instead
of coming ready-made into the world, are mixed
and molded in bake-rooms where men work sweating
by night, stripped to the waist, like stokers.

<p>Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s letter, which reached me Monday,
was very short and almost curt. It depressed me for
a day. I tried to fight against that feeling, when it
threatened to return yesterday, and was at Peter&#8217;s
piano shouting to the kiddies:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Coon, Coon, Coon, I wish my color&#8217;d fade!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Coon, Coon, Coon, I&#8217;d like a different shade!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>when Struthers carried in to me, with a sort of triumphant
and tight-lipped I-told-you-so air, a copy of
the morning&#8217;s <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i>. She had it
folded so that I found myself confronting a picture
of Lady Alicia Newland, Lady Alicia in the &#8220;Teddy-Bear&#8221;
suit of an aviator, with a fur-lined leather
jacket and helmet and heavy gauntlets and leggings
and the same old audacious look out of the quietly
smiling eyes, which were squinting a little because of
the sunlight.
</p>
<p>Lady Allie, I found on perusing the letter-press,
had been flying with some of the North Island officers
down in San Diego Bay. And now she and the Right
Honorable Lieutenant-Colonel Brereton Ainsley-Brook,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
of the British Imperial Commission to Canada,
were to attempt a flight to Kelly Field Number Two,
at San Antonio, in Texas, in a De Haviland machine.
She had told the <i>Examiner</i> reporter who had caught
her as she stood beside a naval sea-plane, that she
&#8220;loved&#8221; flying and loved taking a chance and that her
worst trouble was with nose-bleed, which she&#8217;d get
over in time, she felt sure. And if the Texas flight
was a success she would try to arrange for a flight
down to the Canal at the same time that the Pacific
fleet comes through from Colon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that &#8217;er, all over?&#8221; demanded Struthers, forgetting
her place and her position and even her aspirate
in the excitement of the moment. But I handed
back the paper without comment. For a day, however,
Lady Allie has loomed large in my thoughts.

<p>It will be two weeks to-morrow since I&#8217;ve had a line
from Dinky-Dunk. The world about me is a world
of beauty, but I&#8217;m worried and restless and Edna
Millay&#8217;s lines keep running through my head:

<p>Peter has written to me saying that unless he hears
from me to the contrary he thinks he can arrange to
&#8220;run through&#8221; to the Coast in time for the Rose
Tournament here on New Year&#8217;s Day. He takes
the trouble to explain that he&#8217;ll stay at the Alexandria
in Los Angeles, so there&#8217;ll be no possible disturbance
to me and my family routine.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s so like Peter!
</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s been no word from Dinky-Dunk. The
conviction is growing in my mind that he&#8217;s not at
Alabama Ranch.

<h2><i>Monday the Twenty-first</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A letter has just come to me this morning from
Whinstane Sandy, written in lead-pencil. It said,
with an orthography all its own, that Duncan had
been in bed for two weeks with what they thought was
pneumonia, but was up again and able to eat something,
and not to worry. It seemed a confident and
cheerful message at first, but the oftener I read it
the more worried I became. So one load was taken
off my heart only to make room for another. My first
decision was to start north at once, to get back to
Alabama Ranch and my Dinky-Dunk as fast as steam
could take me. I was still the sharer of his joys and
sorrows, and ought to be with him when things were
at their worst. But on second thought it didn&#8217;t seem
quite fair to the kiddies, to dump them from midsummer
into shack-life and a sub-zero climate. And
always, always, always, there were the children to be
considered. So I wired Ed Sherman, the station-agent
at Buckhorn, asking him to send out a message
to Duncan, saying I was waiting for him in Pasadena
and to come at once....
</p>
<p>I wonder what his answer will be? It&#8217;s surrender,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
on my part. It&#8217;s capitulation, and Dinky-Dunk, of
course, will recognize that fact. Or he ought to. But
it&#8217;s not this I&#8217;m worrying over. It&#8217;s Duncan himself,
and his health. It gives me a guilty feeling....
I once thought that I was made to heal hearts. But
about all I can do, I find, is to bruise them.

</div>

<p>A telegram of just one word has come from
Duncan, dated at Calgary. It said: &#8220;Coming.&#8221; I
could feel a little tremble in my knees as I read it.
He must be better, or he&#8217;d never be able to travel.
To-morrow will be Christmas Day, but we&#8217;ve decided
to postpone all celebration until the kiddies&#8217; daddy
is on the scene. It will never seem much like Christmas
to us Eskimos, at eighty-five in the shade. And
we&#8217;re temporarily subduing that red-ink day to the
eyes of the children by carefully secreting in one of
Peter&#8217;s clothes-closets each and every present that has
come for them.

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-seventh</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk is here. He arrived this morning,
and we were all at the station in our best bib-and-tucker
and making a fine show of being offhanded and
light-hearted. But when I saw the porter helping
down my Diddums, so white-faced and weak and tired-looking,
something swelled up and burst just under
my floating ribs and for a moment I thought my heart
had had a blow-out like a tire and stopped working
for ever and ever. Heaven knows I held my hands
tight, and tried to be cheerful, but in spite of everything
I could do, on the way home, I couldn&#8217;t stop the
tears from running slowly down my cheeks. They
kept running and running, as though I had nothing
to do with it, exactly as a wound bleeds. The poor
man, of course, was done out by the long trip. He
was just <i>blooey</i>, and saved himself from being pitiful
by shrinking back into a shell of chalky-faced self-sufficiency.
He has said very little, and has eaten
nothing, but had a sleep this afternoon for a couple
of hours, out in the <i>patio</i> on a <i>chaise-longue</i>. It hurt
him, I think, to find his own children look at him with
such cold and speculative eyes. But he has changed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
shockingly since they last saw him. And they have
so much to fill up their little lives. They haven&#8217;t yet
reached the age when life teaches them they&#8217;d better
stick to what&#8217;s given them, even though there&#8217;s a bitter
tang to its sweetness!

<h2><i>Wednesday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It is incredible, what three days of rest and forced
feeding at my implacable hands, have done for Dinky-Dunk.
He is still a little shaky on his pins, if he
walks far, and the noonday sun makes him dizzy, but
his eyes don&#8217;t look so much like saucers and I haven&#8217;t
heard the trace of a cough from him all to-day. Illness,
of course, is not romantic, but it plays its altogether
too important part in life, and has to be faced.
And there is something so disturbingly immuring and
depersonalizing about it! Dinky-Dunk appears
rather in a world by himself. Only once, so far, has
he seemed to step back to our every-day old world.
That was when he wandered into the Blue Room in
the East Wing where little Dinkie has been sleeping.
I was seated beside his little lordship&#8217;s bed singing:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;The little pigs sleep with their tails curled up,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and when that had been exhausted, rambling on to
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;The sailor being both tall and slim,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The lady fell in love with him,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>when <i>pater familias</i> wandered in and inquired, &#8220;Whyfore
the cabaret?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>I explained that Dinkie, since coming south, had
seemed to demand an even-song or two before slipping
off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that I&#8217;ll have to take our son in hand,&#8221;
announced Dinky-Dunk&mdash;but there was just the
shadow of a smile about his lips as he went slowly out
and closed the door after him.
</p>
<p>To-night, when I told Dinky-Dunk that Peter
would in all likelihood be here to-morrow, he listened
without batting an eyelash. But he asked if I&#8217;d mind
handing him a cigarette, and he studied my face long
and intently. I don&#8217;t know what he saw there, or
what he concluded, for I did my best to keep it as noncommittal
as possible. If there is any move, it must
be from him. That sour-inked Irishman called Shaw
has said that women are the wooers in this world. A
lot he knows about it!... Yet something has
happened, in the last half-hour, which both disturbs
and puzzles me. When I was unpacking Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
second trunk, which had stood neglected for
almost four long days, I came across the letter which
I thought I&#8217;d put away in the back of the ranch
ledger and had failed to find.... And he had
it, all the time!
</p>
<p>The redoubtable Struthers, it must be recorded,
to-day handed me another paper, and almost as triumphantly
as the first one. She&#8217;d picked it up on her
way home from the druggist&#8217;s, where she went for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
aspirin for Dinky-Dunk. On what was labeled its
&#8220;Woman&#8217;s Page&#8221; was yet another photographic
reproduction of the fair Lady Allie in aviation togs
and a head-line which read: &#8220;Insists On Tea Above
The Clouds.&#8221; But I plainly disappointed the expectant
Struthers by promptly handing the paper back
to her and by declining to make any comment.

<h2><i>Thursday the Thirty-first</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Peter walked in on us to-day, a little less spick and
span, I&#8217;m compelled to admit, than I had expected of
one in his position, but as easy and unconcerned as
though he had dropped in from across the way for a
cigarette and a cup of tea. And I played up to that
pose by having Struthers wheel the tea-wagon out into
the <i>patio</i>, where we gathered about it in a semicircle,
as decorously as though we were sitting in a curate&#8217;s
garden to talk over the program for the next meeting
of the Ladies&#8217; Auxiliary.
</p>
<p>There we sat, Dinky-Dunk, my husband who was
in love with another woman; Peter, my friend, who
was in love with me, and myself, who was too busy
bringing up a family to be in love with anybody.
There we sat in that beautiful garden, in that balmy
and beautiful afternoon sunlight, with the bamboos
whispering and a mocking-bird singing from its place
on the pepper-tree, stirring our small cups and saying
&#8220;Lemon, please,&#8221; or &#8220;Just one lump, thank you.&#8221; It
may not be often, but life <i>does</i> occasionally surprise
us by being theatrical. For I could not banish from
my bones an impression of tremendous reservations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
of guarded waiting and watching from every point of
that sedate and quiet-mannered little triangle. Yet
for only one moment had I seen it come to the front.
That was during the moment when Dinky-Dunk and
Peter first shook hands. On both faces, for that
moment, I caught the look with which two knights
measure each other. Peter, as he lounged back in his
wicker chair and produced his familiar little briar
pipe, began to remind me rather acutely of that
pensive old <i>picador</i> in Zuloaga&#8217;s <i>The Victim of The
Fête</i>, the placid and plaintive and only vaguely hopeful
knight on his bony old Rosinante, not quite ignorant
of the fact that he must forage on to other fields
and look for better luck in newer ventures, yet not
quite forgetful that life, after all, is rather a blithe
adventure and that the man who refuses to surrender
his courage, no matter what whimsical turns the
adventure may take, is still to be reckoned the conqueror.
But later on he was jolly enough and direct
enough, when he got to showing Dinky-Dunk his
books and curios. I suppose, at heart, he was about
as interested in those things as an aquarium angel-fish
is in a Sunday afternoon visitor. But if it was
pretense, and nothing more, there was very actual
kindliness in it. And there was nothing left for me
but to sit tight, and refill the little lacquered gold cups
when necessary, and smile non-committally when
Dinky-Dunk explained that my idea of Heaven was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
place where husbands were served <i>en brochette</i>, and
emulate the Priest and the Levite by passing by on
the other side when Peter asked me if I&#8217;d ever heard
that the West was good for mules and men but hard
on horses and women. And it suddenly struck me as
odd, the timidities and reticences which nature imposes
on our souls. It seemed so ridiculous that the three
of us couldn&#8217;t sit there and unbosom our hearts of
what was hidden away in them, that we couldn&#8217;t be
open and honest and aboveboard and say just what
we felt and thought, that we couldn&#8217;t quietly talk
things out to an end and find where each and all of
us stood. But men and women are not made that way.
Otherwise, I suppose, life would be too Edenic, and
we&#8217;d part company with a very old and venerable
interest in Paradise!

<h2><i>Saturday the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Peter had arranged to come for us with a motor-car
and carry us all off to the Rose Tournament yesterday
morning, &#8220;for I do want to be sitting right
next to that little tike of yours,&#8221; he explained, meaning
Dinkie, &#8220;when he bumps into his first brass band!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But little Dinkie didn&#8217;t hear his brass band, and
we didn&#8217;t go to the Rose Tournament, although it was
almost at our doors and some eighty thousand crowded
automobiles foregathered here from the rest of the
state to get a glimpse of it. For Peter, who is staying
at the Greene here instead of at the Alexandria
over in Los Angeles, presented himself before I&#8217;d even
sat down to breakfast and before lazy old Dinky-Dunk
was even out of bed.
</p>
<p>Peter, I noticed, had a somewhat hollow look about
the eye, but I accepted it as nothing more than the
after-effects of his long trip, and blithely commanded
him to sit down and partake of my coffee.
</p>
<p>Peter, however, wasn&#8217;t thinking about coffee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he began, &#8220;that I&#8217;m bringing you
rather&mdash;rather bad news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We stood for a moment with our gazes locked. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
seemed appraising me, speculating on just what effect
this message of his might have on me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked, with that forlorn tug at
inner reserves which life teaches us to send over the
wire as we grow older.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; explained Peter, &#8220;simply because this
thing would have reached you a little later in your
morning paper&mdash;and I hated the thought of having it
spring out at you that way. So you won&#8217;t mind, will
you? You&#8217;ll understand the motive behind the
message?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it?&#8221; I repeated, a little astonished by
this obliquity in a man customarily so direct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Lady Newland,&#8221; he finally said. And
the solemnity of his face rather frightened me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not dead?&#8221; I asked in a breath.
</p>
<p>Peter shook his head from side to side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been rather badly hurt,&#8221; he said, after several
moments of silence. &#8220;Her plane was winged yesterday
afternoon by a navy flier over San Diego Bay.
She didn&#8217;t fall, but it was a forced landing and her
machine had taken fire before they could get her out
of her seat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean she was burnt?&#8221; I cried, chilled by the
horror of it.
</p>
<p>And, inapposite as it seemed, my thoughts flashed
back to that lithe and buoyant figure, and then to the
picture of it charred and scorched and suffering.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Only her face,&#8221; was Peter&#8217;s quiet and very deliberate
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only her face,&#8221; I repeated, not quite understanding
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men from the North Bay field had her out a
minute or two after she landed. But practically the
whole plane was afire. Her heavy flying coat and
gauntlets saved her body and hands. But her face
was unprotected. She&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean she&#8217;ll be <i>disfigured</i>?&#8221; I asked, remembering
the loveliness of that face with its red and wilful
lips and its ever-changing tourmaline eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; was Peter&#8217;s answer. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
been wiring, and you&#8217;ll be quite safe in telling your
husband that she&#8217;s in no actual danger. The Marine
Hospital officials have acknowledged that no flame was
inhaled, that it&#8217;s merely temporary shock, and, of
course, the face-burn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can they do?&#8221; I asked, in little more than
a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re trying the new ambersine treatment, and
later on, I suppose, they can rely on skin-grafting and
facial surgery,&#8221; Peter explained to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it that bad?&#8221; I asked, sitting down in one of the
empty chairs, for the mere effort to vision any such
disfigurement had brought a Channel-crossing and
Calais-packet feeling to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very sad,&#8221; said Peter, more ill-at-ease than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
I&#8217;d ever seen him before, &#8220;But there&#8217;s positively no
danger, remember. It won&#8217;t be so bad as your morning
paper will try to make it out. They&#8217;ve sensationalized
it, of course. That&#8217;s why I wanted to be
here first, and give you the facts. They are distressing
enough, God knows, without those yellow reporters
working them over for wire consumption.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was glad that Peter didn&#8217;t offer to stay, didn&#8217;t
even seem to wish to stay. I wanted quietness and
time to think the thing over. Dinky-Dunk, I realized,
would have to be told, and told at once. It would, of
course, be a shock to him. And it would be something
more. It would be a sudden crowding to some final
issue of all those possibilities which lay like spring-traps
beneath the under-brush of our indifference.
I had no way of knowing what it was that had
attracted him to Lady Alicia. Beauty of face, of
course, must have been a factor in it. And that beauty
was now gone. But love, according to the Prophets
and the Poets, overcometh all things. And in her very
helplessness, it was only too plain to me, his Cousin
Allie might appeal to him in a more personal and more
perilous way. My Diddums himself, of late, had
appealed more to me in his weakness and his unhappiness
than in his earlier strength and triumph. There
was a time, in fact, when I had almost grown to hate
his successes. And yet he was my husband. He was
<i>mine</i>. And it was a human enough instinct to fight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
for what was one&#8217;s own. But that wild-bird part of
man known as his will could never be caged and
chained. If somewhere far off it beheld beauty and
nobility it must be free to wing its way where it
wished. The only bond that held it was the bond of
free-giving and goodness. And if it abjured such
things as that, the sooner the flight took place and
the colors were shown, the better. If on the home-bough
beside him nested neither beauty nor nobility,
it was only natural that he should wander a-field for
what I had failed to give him. And now, in this final
test, I must not altogether fail him. For once in my
life, I concluded, I had to be generous.
</p>
<p>So I waited until Dinky-Dunk emerged. I waited,
deep in thought, while he splashed like a sea-lion in
his bath, and called out to Struthers almost gaily for
his glass of orange-juice, and shaved, and opened and
closed drawers, and finished dressing and came out in
his cool-looking suit of cricketer&#8217;s flannel, so immaculate
and freshly-pressed that one would never dream
it had been bought in England and packed in mothballs
for four long years.
</p>
<p>I heard him asking for the kiddies while I was still
out in the <i>patio</i> putting the finishing touches to his
breakfast-table, and his grunt that was half a sigh
when he learned that they&#8217;d been sent off before he&#8217;d
had a glimpse of them. And I could see him inhale a
lungful of the balmy morning air as he stood in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
open doorway and stared, not without approval, at
me and the new-minted day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the clouded brow, Lady-Bird?&#8221; he demanded
as he joined me at the little wicker table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some rather disturbing news,&#8221; I told
him, wondering just how to begin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The kiddies?&#8221; he asked, stopping short.
</p>
<p>I stared at him closely as I shook my head in
answer to that question. He looked leaner and frailer
and less robustious than of old. But in my heart of
hearts I liked him that way. It left him the helpless
and unprotesting victim of that run-over maternal
instinct of mine which took wayward joy in mothering
what it couldn&#8217;t master. It had brought him a little
closer to me. But that contact, I remembered, was
perhaps to be only something of the moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I told him as quietly as I could,
&#8220;I want you to go down to San Diego and see Lady
Allie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a less surprised look than a barricaded one
that came into his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked as he slowly seated himself across
the table from me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I think she needs you,&#8221; I found the courage
to tell him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked still again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been an accident,&#8221; I told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of accident?&#8221; he quickly inquired, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
one hand arrested as he went to shake out his table-napkin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an air-ship accident. And Lady Allie&#8217;s
been hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Badly?&#8221; he asked, as our glances met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not badly, in one way,&#8221; I explained to him.
&#8220;She&#8217;s not in any danger, I mean. But her plane
caught fire, and she&#8217;s been burned about the face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His lips parted slightly, as he sat staring at me.
And slowly up into his colorless face crept a blighted
look, a look which brought a vague yet vast unhappiness
to me as I sat contemplating it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean she&#8217;s disfigured,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that
it&#8217;s something she&#8217;ll always&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; I said, when he did not finish his
sentence.
</p>
<p>He sat looking down at his empty plate for a long
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want me to go?&#8221; he finally said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I told him.
</p>
<p>He was silent for still another ponderable space of
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you understand&mdash;&#8221; he began. And for
the second time he didn&#8217;t finish his sentence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; I told him, doing my best to sit
steady under his inquisitorial eye. Then he looked
down at the empty plate again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said at last. He spoke in a quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
flat and colorless tone. But it masked a decision
which we both must have recognized as being momentous.
And I knew, without saying anything further,
that he would go.

<h2><i>Sunday the Third</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk left Friday night and got back early
this morning before I was up. This naturally surprised
me. But what surprised me more was the way
he looked. He was white and shaken and drawn about
the eyes. He seemed so wretched that I couldn&#8217;t help
feeling sorry for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>She wouldn&#8217;t see me!</i>&#8221; was all he said as I stopped
him on the way to his room.
</p>
<p>But he rather startled me, fifteen minutes later, by
calling up the Greene and asking for Peter. And
before half an hour had dragged past Peter appeared
in person. He ignored the children, and apparently
avoided me, and went straight out to the pergola,
where he and Dinky-Dunk fell to pacing slowly up
and down, with the shadows dappling their white-clad
shoulders like leopards as they walked up and
down, up and down, as serious and solemn as two ministers
of state in a national crisis. And something, I
scarcely knew what, kept me from going out and
joining them.
</p>
<p>It was Peter himself who finally came in to me.
He surprised me, in the first place, by shaking hands.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
He did it with that wistful wandering-picador smile
of his on his rather Zuloagaish face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say good-by,&#8221; I found him saying
to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; I called out in startled protest, trying to
draw back so I could see him better. But he kept
my hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going east to-night,&#8221; he quite casually
announced. &#8220;But above all things I want you and
your Dinky-Dunk to hang on here as long as you can.
<i>He</i> needs it. I&#8217;m stepping out. No, I don&#8217;t mean
that, exactly, for I&#8217;d never stepped in. But it&#8217;s a fine
thing, in this world, for men and women to be real
friends. And I know, until we shuffle off, that we&#8217;re
going to be that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; I cried again, trying not to choke up with
the sudden sense of deprivation that was battering my
heart to pieces. And the light in faithful old Peter&#8217;s
eyes didn&#8217;t make it any easier.
</p>
<p>But he dropped my hand, of a sudden, and went
stumbling rather awkwardly over the Spanish tiling as
he passed out to the waiting car. I watched him as
he climbed into it, stiffly yet with a show of careless
bravado, for all the world like the lean-jowled knight
of the vanished fête mounting his bony old Rosinante.
</p>
<p>It was nearly half an hour later that Dinky-Dunk
came into the cool-shadowed living-room where I was
making a pretense of being busy at cutting down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
some of Dinkie&#8217;s rompers for Pee-Wee, who most
assuredly must soon bid farewell to skirts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sit down, please?&#8221; he said with an
abstracted sort of formality. For he&#8217;d caught me on
the wing, half-way back from the open window, where
I&#8217;d been glancing out to make sure Struthers was on
guard with the children.
</p>
<p>My face was a question, I suppose, even when I
didn&#8217;t speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I want you to be very quiet
and courageous about,&#8221; was my husband&#8217;s none too
tranquillizing beginning. And I could feel my pulse
quicken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked, wondering just what women
should do to make themselves quiet and courageous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Allie,&#8221; answered my husband, speaking
so slowly and deliberately that it sounded unnatural.
&#8220;She shot herself last night. She&mdash;she killed
herself, with an army revolver she&#8217;d borrowed from
a young officer down there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t quite understand, at first. The words
seemed like half-drowned things my mind had to work
over and resuscitate and coax, back into life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is terrible!&#8221; I said at last, feebly, foolishly,
as the meaning of it all filtered through my none too
active brain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible for me,&#8221; acknowledged Dinky-Dunk,
with a self-pity which I wasn&#8217;t slow to resent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But why aren&#8217;t you there?&#8221; I demanded. &#8220;Why
aren&#8217;t you there to keep a little decency about the
thing? Why aren&#8217;t you looking after what&#8217;s left
of her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s eye evaded mine, but only for a
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Ainsley-Brook is coming back from Washington
to take possession of the remains,&#8221; he explained
with a sort of dry-lipped patience, &#8220;and take them
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should an outsider like&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk stopped me with a gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He and Allie were married, a little over three weeks
ago,&#8221; my husband quietly informed me. And for
the second time I had to work life into what seemed
limp and sodden words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know about that?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Allie wrote to me about it, at the time,&#8221; he
replied with a sort of coerced candor. &#8220;She said it
seemed about the only thing left to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should she say that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk stared at me with something strangely
like a pleading look in his haggard eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to keep away from all that,
at a time like this?&#8221; he finally asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;this is the time we <i>can&#8217;t</i> keep
away from it. She wrote you that because she was in
love with you. Isn&#8217;t that the truth?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk raised his hand, as though he were
attempting a movement of protest, and then dropped
it again. His eyes, I noticed, were luminous with
a sort of inward-burning misery. But I had no
intention of being merciful. I had no chance of being
merciful. It was like an operation without ether, but
it had to be gone through with. It had to be cut out,
in some way, that whole cancerous growth of hate
and distrust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the truth?&#8221; I repeated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tabby, don&#8217;t turn the knife in the wound!&#8221;
cried Dinky-Dunk, with his face more than ever
pinched with misery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it <i>is</i> a wound!&#8221; I proclaimed in dolorous
enough triumph. &#8220;But there&#8217;s still another question,
Dinky-Dunk, you must answer,&#8221; I went on, speaking
as slowly and precisely as I could, as though deliberation
in speech might in some way make clearer a matter
recognized as only too dark in spirit. &#8220;And it
must be answered honestly, without any quibble as
to the meaning of words. Were you in love with Lady
Allie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His gesture of repugnance, of seeming self-hate,
was both a prompt and a puzzling one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hideous, the simply hideous part of it
all,&#8221; he cried out in a sort of listless desperation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why hideous?&#8221; I demanded, quite clear-headed,
and quite determined that now or never the overscored
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
slate of suspicion should be wiped clean. I
still forlornly and foolishly felt, I suppose, that he
might yet usher before me some miraculously simple
explanation that would wipe his scutcheon clean, that
would put everything back to the older and happier
order. But as I heard his deep-wrung cry of &#8220;Oh,
what&#8217;s the good of all this?&#8221; I knew that life wasn&#8217;t
so romantic as we&#8217;re always trying to make it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to know,&#8221; I said, as steel-cold as a
surgeon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you see that it&#8217;s&mdash;that it&#8217;s worse than
revolting to me?&#8221; he contended, with the look of a man
harried beyond endurance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should it be?&#8221; I exacted.
</p>
<p>He sank down in the low chair with the ranch-brand
on its leather back. It was an oddly child-like
movement of collapse. But I daren&#8217;t let myself feel
sorry for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s all so rottenly ignoble,&#8221; he said, without
looking at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For whom?&#8221; I asked, trying to speak calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For me&mdash;for you,&#8221; he cried out, with his head in
his hands. &#8220;For you to have been faced with, I mean.
It&#8217;s awful, to think that you&#8217;ve had to stand it!&#8221; He
reached out for me, but I was too far away for him
to touch. &#8220;Oh, Tabby, I&#8217;ve been such an awful rotter.
And this thing that&#8217;s happened has just brought it
home to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you cared, that much?&#8221; I demanded, feeling
the bottom of my heart fall out, for all the world
like the floor of a dump-cart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; that&#8217;s the unforgivable part of it,&#8221; he
cried in quick protest. &#8220;It&#8217;s not only that I did you a
great wrong, Tabby, but I did <i>her</i> a worse one. I
coolly exploited something that I should have at least
respected. I manipulated and used a woman I should
have been more generous with. There wasn&#8217;t even
bigness in it, from my side of the game. I traded on
that dead woman&#8217;s weakness. And my hands would
be cleaner if I could come to you with the claim that
I&#8217;d really cared for her, that I&#8217;d been swept off my
feet, that passion had blinded me to the things I
should have remembered.&#8221; He let his hands fall
between his knees. Knowing him as the man of
reticence that he was, it seemed an indescribably tragic
gesture. And it struck me as odd, the next moment,
that he should be actually sobbing. &#8220;Oh, my dear,
my dear, the one thing I was blind to was your bigness,
was your goodness. The one thing I forgot was
how true blue you could be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sat there staring at his still heaving shoulders,
turning over what he had said, turning it over and
over, like a park-squirrel with a nut. I found a great
deal to think about, but little to say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for despising me,&#8221; Dinky-Dunk
said, out of the silence, once more in control of himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of <i>her</i>,&#8221; I explained. And then I
found the courage to look into my husband&#8217;s face.
&#8220;No, Dinky-Dunk, I don&#8217;t despise you,&#8221; I told him,
remembering that he was still a weak and shaken man.
&#8220;But I pity you. I do indeed pity you. For it&#8217;s selfishness,
it seems to me, which costs us so much, in
the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seemed to agree with me, by a slow movement
of the head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only glimmer of hope I have,&#8221; he surprised
me by saying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why hope from <i>that</i>?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re so utterly without selfishness,&#8221;
that deluded man cried out to me. &#8220;You were always
that way, but I didn&#8217;t have the brains to see it. I
never quite saw it until you sent me down to&mdash;to <i>her</i>.&#8221;
He came to a stop, and sat staring at the terra-cotta
Spanish floor-tiles. &#8220;<i>I</i> knew it was useless, tragically
useless. You didn&#8217;t. But you were brave enough to
let my weakness do its worst, if it had to. And that
makes me feel that I&#8217;m not fit to touch you, that I&#8217;m
not even fit to walk on the same ground with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I tried my best to remain judicial.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this, Dinky-Dunk, isn&#8217;t being quite fair to
either of us,&#8221; I protested, turning away to push in a
hair-pin so that he wouldn&#8217;t see the tremble that I
could feel in my lower lip. For an unreasonable and
illogical and absurdly big wave of compassion for my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
poor old Dinky-Dunk was welling up through my
tired body, threatening to leave me and all my make-believe
dignity as wobbly as a street-procession Queen
of Sheba on her circus-float. I was hearing, I knew,
the words that I&#8217;d waited for, this many a month.
I was at last facing the scene I&#8217;d again and again
dramatized on the narrow stage of my woman&#8217;s imagination.
But instead of bringing me release, it brought
me heart-ache; instead of spelling victory, it came
involved with the thin humiliations of compromise.
For things could never be the same again. The blot
was there on the scutcheon, and could never be argued
away. The man I loved had let the grit get into the
bearings of his soul, had let that grit grind away life&#8217;s
delicate surfaces without even knowing the wine of
abandoned speed. He had been nothing better than
the passive agent, the fretful and neutral factor, the
cheated one without even the glory of conquest or
the tang of triumph. But he had been saved for me.
He was there within arm&#8217;s reach of me, battered, but
with the wine-glow of utter contrition on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me back, <i>Babushka</i>,&#8221; I could hear his shaken
voice imploring. &#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve it&mdash;but I can&#8217;t go
on without you. I can&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve had enough of hell.
And I need you more than anything else in this
world!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That, I had intended telling him, wasn&#8217;t playing
quite fair. But when he reached out his hands toward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
me, exactly as I&#8217;ve seen his own Dinky do at nightfall
when a darkening room left his little spirit
hungry for companionship, something melted like an
overlooked chocolate <i>mousse</i> in my crazy old maternal
heart, and before I was altogether aware of it I&#8217;d let
my hands slip over his shoulders as he knelt with his
bowed head in my lap. The sight of his colorless and
unhappy face with that indescribable homeless-dog
look in his eyes was too much for me. I gave up.
I hugged his head to my breast-bone as though it
were my only life-buoy in an empty and endless Atlantic
and only stopped when I had to rub the end of my
nose, which I couldn&#8217;t keep a collection of several big
tears from tickling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fool, Dinky-Dunk, a most awful fool,&#8221; I
tried to tell him, when he gave me a chance to breathe
again. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got a temper like a bob-cat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Beloved,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;it&#8217;s not foolishness&mdash;it&#8217;s
nobility!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t answer him, for his arms had closed
about me again. &#8220;And I love you, Tabbie, I love you
with every inch of my body!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Women are weak. And there is no such thing, so
far as I know, as an altogether and utterly perfect
man. So we must winnow strength out of our weakness,
make the best of a bad bargain, and over-scroll
the walls of our life-cell with the illusions which may
come to mean as much as the stone and iron that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
imprison us. All we can do, we who are older and
wiser, is wistfully to overlook the wobble where the
meshed perfection of youth has been bruised and
abused and loosened, tighten up the bearings,
and keep as blithely as we can to the worn
old road. For life, after all, is a turn-pike
of concession deep-bedded with compromise. And
our To-morrows are only our To-days over
again.... So Dinky-Dunk, who keeps saying
in unexpected and intriguing ways that he can&#8217;t
live without me, is trying to make love to me as he
did in the old days before he got salt-and-peppery
above the ears. And I&#8217;m blockhead enough to believe
him. I&#8217;m like an old shoe, I suppose, comfortable but
not showy. Yet it&#8217;s the children we really have to
think of. Our crazy old patch-work of the Past may
be our own, but the Future belongs to them. There&#8217;s
a heap of good, though, in my humble-eyed old
Dinky-Dunk, too much good ever to lose him, whatever
may have happened in the days that are over.

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-fourth</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Dinky-Dunk, whom I actually heard singing as he
took his bath this morning, is exercising his paternal
prerogative of training little Dinkie to go to bed
without a light. He has peremptorily taken the matter
out of my hands, and is, of course, prodigiously
solemn about it all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show that young Turk who&#8217;s boss around this
house!&#8221; he magisterially proclaims almost every night
when the youthful wails of protest start to come from
the Blue Room in the East Wing.
</p>
<p>And off he goes, with his Holbein&#8217;s Astronomer
mouth set firm and the fiercest of frowns on his face.
</p>
<p>It had a tendency to terrify me, at first. But now I
know what a colossal old fraud and humbug this same
soft-hearted and granite-crusted specimen of humanity
can be. For last night, after the usual demonstration,
I slipped out to the Blue Room and found
big Dunkie kneeling down beside little Dinkie&#8217;s bed,
with Dinkie&#8217;s small hand softly enclosed in his dad&#8217;s
big paw, and Dinkie&#8217;s yellow head nestled close
against his dad&#8217;s salt-and-peppery pate.
</p>
<p>It made me gulp a little, for some reason or other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
So I tiptoed away, without letting my lord and master
know I&#8217;d discovered the secret of that stern mastery
of his. And later on Dinky-Dunk himself tiptoed
into Peter&#8217;s study, farther down the same wing, so
that he could, with a shadow of truth, explain that
he&#8217;d been looking over some of the Spanish manuscripts
there, when I happened to ask him, on his
return, just what had kept him away so long!
